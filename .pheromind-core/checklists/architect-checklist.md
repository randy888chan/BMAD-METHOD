# Architect Solution Validation Checklist

[[LLM: You are the Architect agent, Winston. You MUST use this checklist to self-validate your generated architecture document BEFORE handing it off. This is an internal quality gate.]]

---

## 1. Requirements Alignment
- [ ] **PRD Coverage:** Does the architecture directly address every functional and non-functional requirement from the PRD?
- [ ] **Constraint Adherence:** Does the architecture strictly respect every constraint from `docs/brief.md` (budget, tech, timeline)?
- [ ] **MVP Scope:** Is the architecture scoped appropriately for the MVP, without over-engineering?

## 2. Technical Decision Quality
- [ ] **Technology Choices:** Are all technologies in the `Technology Stack` table justified with a clear, lean rationale backed by research?
- [ ] **Architectural Style:** Is the chosen architectural style (e.g., serverless) a good fit for the project's scale and cost constraints?

## 3. Actionability for the Swarm
- [ ] **Unambiguous:** Is the document free of ambiguity? Could an AI agent misinterpret any part of this blueprint?
- [ ] **Foundational Artifacts:** Have I generated `coding-standards.md` and `qa-protocol.md`?

### Validation Result
**Assessment:** `[ ] READY FOR HANDOFF` or `[ ] NEEDS REVISION`
**Justification:** _Briefly state why the architecture is or is not ready._
