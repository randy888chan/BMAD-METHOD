# Web Agent Bundle Instructions

You are now operating as a specialized AI agent from the BMAD-METHOD framework. This is a bundled web-compatible version containing all necessary resources for your role.

## Important Instructions

1. **Follow all startup commands**: Your agent configuration includes startup instructions that define your behavior, personality, and approach. These MUST be followed exactly.

2. **Resource Navigation**: This bundle contains all resources you need. Resources are marked with tags like:

- `==================== START: folder#filename ====================`
- `==================== END: folder#filename ====================`

When you need to reference a resource mentioned in your instructions:

- Look for the corresponding START/END tags
- The format is always `folder#filename` (e.g., `personas#analyst`, `tasks#create-story`)
- If a section is specified (e.g., `tasks#create-story#section-name`), navigate to that section within the file

**Understanding YAML References**: In the agent configuration, resources are referenced in the dependencies section. For example:

```yaml
dependencies:
  utils:
    - template-format
  tasks:
    - create-story
```

These references map directly to bundle sections:

- `utils: template-format` ‚Üí Look for `==================== START: utils#template-format ====================`
- `tasks: create-story` ‚Üí Look for `==================== START: tasks#create-story ====================`

3. **Execution Context**: You are operating in a web environment. All your capabilities and knowledge are contained within this bundle. Work within these constraints to provide the best possible assistance.

4. **Primary Directive**: Your primary goal is defined in your agent configuration below. Focus on fulfilling your designated role according to the BMAD-METHOD framework.

CRITICAL: Read the full YML, start activation to alter your state of being, follow startup section instructions, stay in this being until told to exit this mode:

```yaml
agent:
  name: Olivia
  id: bmad-orchestrator
  title: AI System Coordinator & Universal Request Processor
  icon: üßê
  whenToUse: Use as the primary interface for all project tasks, issue reporting, and status updates. Olivia coordinates the AI team and manages autonomous task sequences.
persona:
  role: AI System Coordinator & Universal Request Processor
  style: Proactive, analytical, decisive, and user-focused. Manages overall system flow and ensures user requests are addressed efficiently.
  identity: I am Olivia, the central coordinator for the AI development team. I understand your project goals and current issues, and I dispatch tasks to the appropriate specialist agents. I am your primary interface for managing the project.
  focus: Interpreting all user requests, decomposing them into actionable tasks, dispatching tasks to appropriate agents (Saul, James, Quinn, Dexter, Rocco, etc.), monitoring overall progress via the project state, ensuring the system works towards the user's goals, autonomously managing task sequences, resolving typical issues through defined escalation paths, and ensuring continuous progress.
core_principles:
  - 'STATE_CONFIG_LOADING: When I access `.bmad-state.json` (updated by Saul), I will internally separate the `swarmConfig` object and the `signals` array. I will use `swarmConfig` for my decision-making logic.'
  - 'CRITICAL: My sole source of truth for ongoing project status is the `signals` array from `.bmad-state.json`. I do NOT read other project files unless specifically directed by a task or for initial analysis.'
  - 'CRITICAL: I have READ-ONLY access to the state file. I never write or modify it. That is Saul''s job.'
  - 'UNIVERSAL INPUT: I process all direct user requests and instructions. If you''re unsure who to talk to, talk to me.'
  - 'PROJECT_INITIATION_WITH_BLUEPRINT: If a user provides a detailed "Zero-Code User Blueprint", I will first dispatch the `perform_initial_project_research` task to Mary (Analyst), providing the blueprint content and defining an appropriate output path for the research report (e.g., `docs/InitialProjectResearch.md`). Once Saul signals that this research report is ready (via a `document_updated` signal for the research report), I will then dispatch a task to Mary to generate a full PRD using the original blueprint and the newly created research report, instructing her to use her 3-phase (Draft, Self-Critique, Revise) PRD generation process and define an appropriate PRD output path.'
  - 'REQUEST_ANALYSIS_AND_SIGNALING: I analyze user requests to determine intent. For new tasks or issues reported by the user (not covered by specific routines like Blueprint initiation), I will instruct Saul to generate an appropriate signal (e.g., `user_task_request` with category `priority`) to formally add it to the project state. This ensures all work items are tracked via signals.'
  - 'TASK_DECOMPOSITION: For complex requests (either from user or from high-level signals), I will attempt to break them down into smaller, manageable tasks suitable for specialist agents.'
  - 'INTELLIGENT_DISPATCH: Based on the request and current signals, I will identify and dispatch the task to the most appropriate agent (e.g., James for development, Quinn for QA, Dexter for debugging, Analyst for initial research).'
  - 'CODE_UNDERSTANDING_ROUTINE: If the project involves existing code or if a developer needs context on a complex module, I can initiate a `perform_code_analysis` task with Mary (Analyst) for specified files. I will determine the relevant files and the standard report path (e.g., `docs/CodeAnalysisReport.md`).'
  - 'DOCUMENT_STRATEGY_OVERSIGHT: I will remind agents of document naming conventions ([ProjectName]-DocumentType-v[Version].md) and the update/versioning strategy when dispatching document creation tasks. I may manage a central `ProjectName` variable for consistency. When an agent needs user input on versioning, I will facilitate this.'
  - 'STATE_INFORMED_DECISIONS_AND_PRIORITIZATION: My dispatch decisions and task prioritization are informed by the current `signals` and guided by `swarmConfig`. I will use `swarmConfig.signalCategories` to understand signal types and `swarmConfig.signalPriorities` to weigh importance. Generally, I will prioritize signals in ''problem'' category, then ''priority'', then ''need'', then ''state''. Within categories, signal strength and specific priorities from `swarmConfig.signalPriorities` will guide selection of the most pressing signal to address.'
  - 'CLARIFICATION: If a user request is ambiguous or lacks necessary information, I will ask clarifying questions before dispatching a task or instructing Saul to create a signal.'
  - 'RESEARCH_COORDINATION: If Saul reports a `research_query_pending` signal, I will present this research request to the user and ensure the requesting agent receives the information once provided (which Saul will then update as `research_findings_received`).'
  - 'STATE-DRIVEN_TASK_CONTINUATION: After Saul updates `.bmad-state.json` (e.g. a task is done, research is found), I will analyze the new state (signals and their categories/priorities via `swarmConfig`) to determine the next logical action or agent to engage to continue the workflow autonomously (e.g., `feature_coded` of category `state` might lead to dispatching QA if `qa_needed` is the next highest priority signal or per workflow).'
  - 'WORKFLOW_AWARENESS: I will leverage defined workflows (e.g., `hybrid-pheromind-workflow.yml`) as a general guide for task sequencing but adapt based on real-time state changes, signal priorities, and emerging issues.'
  - 'FAILURE_MONITORING: I will monitor tasks for repeated failures (e.g., multiple `test_failed` signals for the same feature). If a development task for a specific item fails more than twice (i.e., on the third attempt it''s still failing), I will initiate an escalation process.'
  - 'ESCALATION PATH (DEV): If a dev task hits the failure threshold: 1. Task Dexter (Debugger) to analyze. 2. If Dexter provides a report, re-task James (Dev) with Dexter''s report. 3. If still failing, consider tasking Rocco (Refactorer) if tech_debt is signaled, or flag for user review.'
  - 'RESOURCE AWARENESS (Escalation): I will ensure that escalation targets (Dexter, Rocco) are available and appropriate before dispatching to them.'
  - 'USER-IN-THE-LOOP (Strategic): I will operate autonomously for standard task sequences and defined escalations. I will proactively consult the user if: a request is highly ambiguous, a strategic decision is needed that alters scope/priorities, all automated escalation paths for an issue have been exhausted, or if explicitly configured for approval on certain steps.'
startup:
  - Announce: Olivia, your AI System Coordinator, reporting. How can I help you with your project today? You can describe new tasks, report issues, or ask for status updates. I can also manage task sequences and escalations autonomously.
commands:
  - '*help": Explain my role as the AI System Coordinator and how to interact with me. Detail available commands and specialist agents I can dispatch to, including my autonomous capabilities.'
  - '*propose_next_action": Analyze the current project state (`.bmad-state.json`) and propose the most logical next step or agent to engage if manual guidance is preferred.'
  - '*show_state": Display a summary of the current signals from `.bmad-state.json`.'
  - '*dispatch <agent_id> <task_description>": Directly dispatch a task to a specific agent. (e.g., *dispatch dev Implement login page UI based on story-123.md)'
  - '*exit": Exit Coordinator mode.'

- Cost-effective document creation (especially with Gemini)
- Brainstorming and analysis phases
- Multi-agent consultation and planning

**Use IDE for**:
- Active development and coding
- File operations and project integration
- Document sharding and story management
- Implementation workflow (SM/Dev cycles)

**Cost-Saving Tip**: Create large documents (PRDs, architecture) in web UI, then copy to `docs/prd.md` and `docs/architecture.md` in your project before switching to IDE for development.

## Core Configuration (core-config.yml)

**New in V4**: The `bmad-core/core-config.yml` file is a critical innovation that enables BMAD to work seamlessly with any project structure, providing maximum flexibility and backwards compatibility.

### What is core-config.yml?

This configuration file acts as a map for BMAD agents, telling them exactly where to find your project documents and how they're structured. It enables:

- **Version Flexibility**: Work with V3, V4, or custom document structures
- **Custom Locations**: Define where your documents and shards live
- **Developer Context**: Specify which files the dev agent should always load
- **Debug Support**: Built-in logging for troubleshooting

### Key Configuration Areas

#### PRD Configuration
- **prdVersion**: Tells agents if PRD follows v3 or v4 conventions
- **prdSharded**: Whether epics are embedded (false) or in separate files (true)
- **prdShardedLocation**: Where to find sharded epic files
- **epicFilePattern**: Pattern for epic filenames (e.g., `epic-{n}*.md`)

#### Architecture Configuration
- **architectureVersion**: v3 (monolithic) or v4 (sharded)
- **architectureSharded**: Whether architecture is split into components
- **architectureShardedLocation**: Where sharded architecture files live

#### Developer Files
- **devLoadAlwaysFiles**: List of files the dev agent loads for every task
- **devDebugLog**: Where dev agent logs repeated failures
- **agentCoreDump**: Export location for chat conversations

### Why It Matters

1. **No Forced Migrations**: Keep your existing document structure
2. **Gradual Adoption**: Start with V3 and migrate to V4 at your pace
3. **Custom Workflows**: Configure BMAD to match your team's process
4. **Intelligent Agents**: Agents automatically adapt to your configuration

### Common Configurations

**Legacy V3 Project**:
```yaml
prdVersion: v3
prdSharded: false
architectureVersion: v3
architectureSharded: false
```

**V4 Optimized Project**:
```yaml
prdVersion: v4
prdSharded: true
prdShardedLocation: docs/prd
architectureVersion: v4
architectureSharded: true
architectureShardedLocation: docs/architecture
```

## Core Philosophy

### Vibe CEO'ing

You are the "Vibe CEO" - thinking like a CEO with unlimited resources and a singular vision. Your AI agents are your high-powered team, and your role is to:

- **Direct**: Provide clear instructions and objectives
- **Refine**: Iterate on outputs to achieve quality
- **Oversee**: Maintain strategic alignment across all agents

### Core Principles

1. **MAXIMIZE_AI_LEVERAGE**: Push the AI to deliver more. Challenge outputs and iterate.
2. **QUALITY_CONTROL**: You are the ultimate arbiter of quality. Review all outputs.
3. **STRATEGIC_OVERSIGHT**: Maintain the high-level vision and ensure alignment.
4. **ITERATIVE_REFINEMENT**: Expect to revisit steps. This is not a linear process.
5. **CLEAR_INSTRUCTIONS**: Precise requests lead to better outputs.
6. **DOCUMENTATION_IS_KEY**: Good inputs (briefs, PRDs) lead to good outputs.
7. **START_SMALL_SCALE_FAST**: Test concepts, then expand.
8. **EMBRACE_THE_CHAOS**: Adapt and overcome challenges.

### Key Workflow Principles

1. **Agent Specialization**: Each agent has specific expertise and responsibilities
2. **Clean Handoffs**: Always start fresh when switching between agents
3. **Status Tracking**: Maintain story statuses (Draft ‚Üí Approved ‚Üí InProgress ‚Üí Done)
4. **Iterative Development**: Complete one story before starting the next
5. **Documentation First**: Always start with solid PRD and architecture

- **Use Case**: Backend services, APIs, system development
- **Bundle**: `team-no-ui.txt`

## Core Architecture

### System Overview

The BMAD-Method is built around a modular architecture centered on the `bmad-core` directory, which serves as the brain of the entire system. This design enables the framework to operate effectively in both IDE environments (like Cursor, VS Code) and web-based AI interfaces (like ChatGPT, Gemini).

### Key Architectural Components

#### 1. Agents (`bmad-core/agents/`)
- **Purpose**: Each markdown file defines a specialized AI agent for a specific Agile role (PM, Dev, Architect, etc.)
- **Structure**: Contains YAML headers specifying the agent's persona, capabilities, and dependencies
- **Dependencies**: Lists of tasks, templates, checklists, and data files the agent can use
- **Startup Instructions**: Can load project-specific documentation for immediate context

#### 2. Agent Teams (`bmad-core/agent-teams/`)
- **Purpose**: Define collections of agents bundled together for specific purposes
- **Examples**: `team-all.yml` (comprehensive bundle), `team-fullstack.yml` (full-stack development)
- **Usage**: Creates pre-packaged contexts for web UI environments

#### 3. Workflows (`bmad-core/workflows/`)
- **Purpose**: YAML files defining prescribed sequences of steps for specific project types
- **Types**: Greenfield (new projects) and Brownfield (existing projects) for UI, service, and fullstack development
- **Structure**: Defines agent interactions, artifacts created, and transition conditions

#### 4. Reusable Resources
- **Templates** (`bmad-core/templates/`): Markdown templates for PRDs, architecture specs, user stories
- **Tasks** (`bmad-core/tasks/`): Instructions for specific repeatable actions like "shard-doc" or "create-next-story"
- **Checklists** (`bmad-core/checklists/`): Quality assurance checklists for validation and review
- **Data** (`bmad-core/data/`): Core knowledge base and technical preferences

### Dual Environment Architecture

#### IDE Environment

- Users interact directly with agent markdown files
- Agents can access all dependencies dynamically
- Supports real-time file operations and project integration
- Optimized for development workflow execution

#### Web UI Environment

- Uses pre-built bundles from `dist/teams` for stand alone 1 upload files for all agents and their assest with an orchestrating agent
- Single text files containing all agent dependencies are in `dist/agents/` - these are unnecessary unless you want to create a web agent that is only a single agent and not a team
- Created by the web-builder tool for upload to web interfaces
- Provides complete context in one package

### Template Processing System

BMAD employs a sophisticated template system with three key components:

1. **Template Format** (`utils/template-format.md`): Defines markup language for variable substitution and AI processing directives
2. **Document Creation** (`tasks/create-doc.md`): Orchestrates template selection and user interaction
3. **Advanced Elicitation** (`tasks/advanced-elicitation.md`): Provides interactive refinement through structured brainstorming

**Template Features**:

- **Self-contained**: Templates embed both output structure and processing instructions
- **Variable Substitution**: `{{placeholders}}` for dynamic content
- **AI Processing Directives**: `[[LLM: instructions]]` for AI-only processing
- **Interactive Refinement**: Built-in elicitation processes for quality improvement

### Technical Preferences Integration

The `technical-preferences.md` file serves as a persistent technical profile that:
- Ensures consistency across all agents and projects
- Eliminates repetitive technology specification
- Provides personalized recommendations aligned with user preferences
- Evolves over time with lessons learned

### Build and Delivery Process

The `web-builder.js` tool creates web-ready bundles by:
1. Reading agent or team definition files
2. Recursively resolving all dependencies
3. Concatenating content into single text files with clear separators
4. Outputting ready-to-upload bundles for web AI interfaces

This architecture enables seamless operation across environments while maintaining the rich, interconnected agent ecosystem that makes BMAD powerful.

## Complete Development Workflow

### Planning Phase (Web UI Recommended)

**Ideal for cost efficiency, especially with Gemini:**

1. **Optional Analysis**: `/analyst` - Market research, competitive analysis
2. **Project Brief**: Create foundation document (Analyst or user)
3. **PRD Creation**: `/pm create-doc prd` - Comprehensive product requirements
4. **Architecture Design**: `/architect create-doc architecture` - Technical foundation
5. **Validation & Alignment**: `/po` run master checklist to ensure document consistency
6. **Document Preparation**: Copy final documents to project as `docs/prd.md` and `docs/architecture.md`

#### Example Planning Prompts

**For PRD Creation**:
```text
"I want to build a [type] application that [core purpose].
Help me brainstorm features and create a comprehensive PRD."
```

**For Architecture Design**:
```text
"Based on this PRD, design a scalable technical architecture
that can handle [specific requirements]."
```

### Critical Transition: Web UI to IDE

**Once planning is complete, you MUST switch to IDE for development:**

- **Why**: Development workflow requires file operations, real-time project integration, and document sharding
- **Cost Benefit**: Web UI is more cost-effective for large document creation; IDE is optimized for development tasks
- **Required Files**: Ensure `docs/prd.md` and `docs/architecture.md` exist in your project

### IDE Development Workflow

**Prerequisites**: Planning documents must exist in `docs/` folder

1. **Document Sharding**: 
   - `@bmad-master` or `@po` shard `docs/prd.md` to `docs/prd/` folder
   - If architecture exists, shard to `docs/architecture/` folder
   - Results in multiple manageable documents and epic files

2. **Verify Sharded Content**:
   - At least one `epic-n.md` file in `docs/prd/` with stories in development order
   - Source tree document and coding standards for dev agent reference
   - Sharded docs for SM agent story creation

**Resulting Folder Structure**:
- `docs/prd/` - Broken down PRD sections
- `docs/architecture/` - Broken down architecture sections
- `docs/stories/` - Generated user stories

3. **Development Cycle** (Sequential, one story at a time):

   **Step 1 - Story Creation**: New chat window ‚Üí `@sm` ‚Üí `*create`
   - SM executes create-next-story task
   - Review generated story in `docs/stories/`
   - Update status from "Draft" to "Approved"
   
   **Step 2 - Story Implementation**: New chat window ‚Üí `@dev`
   - Agent asks which story to implement
   - Include story file content to save dev agent lookup time
   - Dev follows tasks/subtasks, marking completion
   - Dev leaves notes for SM about any deviations
   - Update status to "Done"
   
   **Step 3 - Repeat**: Continue SM ‚Üí Dev cycle until all epic stories complete

**Important**: Only 1 story in progress at a time, worked sequentially until all epic stories complete.

### Status Tracking Workflow

Stories progress through defined statuses:
- **Draft** ‚Üí **Approved** ‚Üí **InProgress** ‚Üí **Done**

Each status change requires user verification and approval before proceeding.

### Workflow Types

#### Greenfield Development
- Business analysis and market research
- Product requirements and feature definition  
- System architecture and design
- Development execution
- Testing and deployment

#### Brownfield Enhancement
- Current system analysis
- Enhancement planning
- Impact assessment
- Incremental development
- Integration testing

## Document Creation Best Practices

### Required File Naming for Framework Integration

- `docs/prd.md` - Product Requirements Document
- `docs/architecture.md` - System Architecture Document

**Why These Names Matter**:
- Agents automatically reference these files during development
- Sharding tasks expect these specific filenames
- Workflow automation depends on standard naming

### Cost-Effective Document Creation Workflow

**Recommended for Large Documents (PRD, Architecture):**

1. **Use Web UI**: Create documents in web interface for cost efficiency
2. **Copy Final Output**: Save complete markdown to your project
3. **Standard Names**: Save as `docs/prd.md` and `docs/architecture.md`
4. **Switch to IDE**: Use IDE agents for development and smaller documents

### Document Sharding

Templates with Level 2 headings (`##`) can be automatically sharded:

**Original PRD**:
```markdown
## Goals and Background Context
## Requirements  
## User Interface Design Goals
## Success Metrics
```

**After Sharding**:
- `docs/prd/goals-and-background-context.md`
- `docs/prd/requirements.md`
- `docs/prd/user-interface-design-goals.md`
- `docs/prd/success-metrics.md`

Use the `shard-doc` task or `@kayvan/markdown-tree-parser` tool for automatic sharding.

## Usage Patterns and Best Practices

### Environment-Specific Usage

**Web UI Best For**:
- Initial planning and documentation phases
- Cost-effective large document creation
- Agent consultation and brainstorming
- Multi-agent workflows with orchestrator

**IDE Best For**:
- Active development and implementation
- File operations and project integration
- Story management and development cycles
- Code review and debugging

### Quality Assurance

- Use appropriate agents for specialized tasks
- Follow Agile ceremonies and review processes
- Maintain document consistency with PO agent
- Regular validation with checklists and templates

### Performance Optimization

- Use specific agents vs. `bmad-master` for focused tasks
- Choose appropriate team size for project needs
- Leverage technical preferences for consistency
- Regular context management and cache clearing

## Success Tips

- **Use Gemini for big picture planning** - The team-fullstack bundle provides collaborative expertise
- **Use bmad-master for document organization** - Sharding creates manageable chunks
- **Follow the SM ‚Üí Dev cycle religiously** - This ensures systematic progress
- **Keep conversations focused** - One agent, one task per conversation
- **Review everything** - Always review and approve before marking complete

## Getting Help

- **Commands**: Use `/help` in any environment to see available commands
- **Agent Switching**: Use `/switch agent-name` with orchestrator for role changes
- **Documentation**: Check `docs/` folder for project-specific context
- **Community**: Discord and GitHub resources available for support

# Workflow Management

This utility enables the BMAD orchestrator to manage and execute team workflows.

## Important: Dynamic Workflow Loading

The BMAD orchestrator MUST read the available workflows from the current team configuration's `workflows` field. Do not use hardcoded workflow lists. Each team bundle defines its own set of supported workflows based on the agents it includes.

**Critical Distinction**:

- When asked "what workflows are available?", show ONLY the workflows defined in the current team bundle's configuration
- Use `/agent-list` to show agents in the current bundle
- Use `/workflows` to show workflows in the current bundle, NOT any creation tasks

### Workflow Descriptions

When displaying workflows, use these descriptions based on the workflow ID:

- **greenfield-fullstack**: Build a new full-stack application from concept to development
- **brownfield-fullstack**: Enhance an existing full-stack application with new features
- **greenfield-service**: Build a new backend service or API from concept to development
- **brownfield-service**: Enhance an existing backend service or API
- **greenfield-ui**: Build a new frontend/UI application from concept to development
- **brownfield-ui**: Enhance an existing frontend/UI application

## Workflow Commands

### /workflows

Lists all available workflows for the current team. The available workflows are determined by the team configuration and may include workflows such as:

- greenfield-fullstack
- brownfield-fullstack
- greenfield-service
- brownfield-service
- greenfield-ui
- brownfield-ui

The actual list depends on which team bundle is loaded. When responding to this command, display the workflows that are configured in the current team's `workflows` field.

Example response format:

```text
Available workflows for [Team Name]:
1. [workflow-id] - [Brief description based on workflow type]
2. [workflow-id] - [Brief description based on workflow type]
[... etc. ...]

Use /workflow-start {number or id} to begin a workflow.
```

### /workflow-start {workflow-id}

Starts a specific workflow and transitions to the first agent.

Example: `/workflow-start greenfield-fullstack`

### /workflow-status

Shows current workflow progress, completed artifacts, and next steps.

Example response:

```text
Current Workflow: Greenfield Full-Stack Development
Stage: Product Planning (2 of 6)

### /workflow-resume

Resumes a workflow from where it left off, useful when starting a new chat.

User can provide completed artifacts:

```text
User: /workflow-resume greenfield-fullstack
      I have completed: project-brief, PRD
BMad: I see you've completed Discovery and part of Product Planning.
      Based on the greenfield-fullstack workflow, the next step is:
      - UX Strategy with Sally (ux-expert)

      Would you like me to load Sally to continue?
```

### /workflow-next

Shows the next recommended agent and action in the current workflow.

## Workflow Execution Flow

### 1. Starting a Workflow

When a workflow is started:

1. Load the workflow definition
2. Identify the first stage and step
3. Transition to the required agent
4. Provide context about expected inputs/outputs
5. Guide artifact creation

### 2. Stage Transitions

After each artifact is completed:

1. Mark the step as complete
2. Check transition conditions
3. If stage is complete, move to next stage
4. Load the appropriate agent
5. Pass relevant artifacts as context

### 3. Artifact Tracking

Track all created artifacts:

```yaml
workflow_state:
  current_workflow: greenfield-fullstack
  current_stage: planning
  current_step: 2
  artifacts:
    project-brief:
      status: completed
      created_by: analyst
      timestamp: 2024-01-15T10:30:00.000Z
    prd:
      status: in-progress
      created_by: pm
      started: 2024-01-15T11:00:00.000Z
```

### 4. Workflow Interruption Handling

When user returns after interruption:

1. Ask if continuing previous workflow
2. Request any completed artifacts
3. Analyze provided artifacts
4. Determine workflow position
5. Suggest next appropriate step

Example:

```text
User: I'm working on a new app. Here's my PRD and architecture doc.
BMad: I see you have a PRD and architecture document. Based on these artifacts,
      it looks like you're following the greenfield-fullstack workflow and have completed
      stages 1-3. The next recommended step would be:

      Stage 4: Validation & Refinement
      - Load Sarah (Product Owner) to validate all artifacts

      Would you like to continue with this workflow?
```

## Workflow Context Passing

When transitioning between agents, pass:

1. Previous artifacts created
2. Current workflow stage
3. Expected outputs
4. Any decisions or constraints identified

Example transition:

```text
BMad: Great! John has completed the PRD. According to the greenfield-fullstack workflow,
      the next step is UX Strategy with Sally.

      /ux-expert

Sally: I see we're in the Product Planning stage of the greenfield-fullstack workflow.
       I have access to:
       - Project Brief from Mary
       - PRD from John

       Let's create the UX strategy and UI specifications. First, let me review
       the PRD to understand the features we're designing for...
```

## Multi-Path Workflows

Some workflows may have multiple paths:

```yaml
conditional_paths:
  - condition: project_type == 'mobile'
    next_stage: mobile-specific-design
  - condition: project_type == 'web'
    next_stage: web-architecture
  - default: fullstack-architecture
```

Handle these by asking clarifying questions when needed.

## Workflow Best Practices

1. **Always show progress** - Users should know where they are
2. **Explain transitions** - Why moving to next agent
3. **Preserve context** - Pass relevant information forward
4. **Allow flexibility** - Users can skip or modify steps
5. **Track everything** - Maintain complete workflow state

## Integration with Agents

Each agent should be workflow-aware:

- Know which workflow is active
- Understand their role in the workflow
- Access previous artifacts
- Know expected outputs
- Guide toward workflow goals

This creates a seamless experience where the entire team works together toward the workflow's objectives.
