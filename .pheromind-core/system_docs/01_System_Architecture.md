# Pheromind System Architecture & Operations Manual

This document describes the high-level architecture and immutable operational rules of the Pheromind Autonomous AI Development System. This is a core part of the **System Constitution**. All agents must operate within this framework.

## Core Concept: The State-Driven Loop

The system operates on a single, continuous work cycle driven by the **Chief Orchestrator & System Interpreter (`@stigmergy-master`, Saul)**. This cycle is not a rigid script but a dynamic loop that reacts to "digital pheromones"â€”the system's shared state.

The **`.ai/state.json`** file is the central nervous system of the swarm. It is the sole source of truth for project status and agent coordination.

## The Pheromind Cycle: A Unified Workflow

1.  **State Interpretation (Saul):**

    - **Input:** At the start of every cycle, Saul's first and only action is to read the `.ai/state.json` file to understand the current `project_status` and the last `system_signal`.
    - **Action:** He acts as the **System Interpreter**, deciding the single most important next step based on his constitutional `STIGMERGY_PROTOCOL`.

2.  **Strategic Dispatch (Saul):**

    - **Action:** Based on his interpretation, Saul acts as the **Chief Orchestrator**, dispatching one specialist agent or sub-orchestrator to perform a specific task. He then enters a waiting state.

3.  **Specialized Execution (The Swarm):**
    - **Input:** A specialist agent (e.g., `@pm`, `@sm`, `@stigmergy-orchestrator`) receives a direct command from Saul.
    - **Action:** The agent performs its narrowly defined task. For development, the **Execution Coordinator (`@stigmergy-orchestrator`, Olivia)** manages the `dev -> qa -> po` micro-cycle for a single story.
    - **Output:** Upon task completion, the agent's final act is to report back to Saul and leave a new `system_signal` in the `state.json` file. This "pheromone" is the trigger for Saul's next interpretation cycle.

## The "Glass Box" Model: Autonomy with Oversight

While designed for full, hands-free operation (`autonomy_mode: "autonomous"`), the system is a "glass box," not a black box. The user can intervene at any time. A manual command or interaction can set the `project_status` to `HUMAN_INPUT_REQUIRED`, which pauses Saul's autonomous loop until the user provides a new directive. This ensures the user remains the ultimate strategic leader.
