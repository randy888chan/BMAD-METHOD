# Pheromind: The Autonomous AI Development Swarm

Pheromind is not a tool; it's an autonomous partner. It translates your strategic vision into a production-ready, commercially-optimized application with minimal human intervention.

The system operates on a "glass box" model. You provide the initial goal, and the swarm takes over, managing the entire lifecycle from planning and architecture to coding, verification, and self-improvement.

## The Pheromind Experience

1.  **Convene:** In your IDE, activate the Chief Strategist, **`@saul`**.
2.  **Directive:** Provide your high-level project goal in a simple text file (e.g., `brief.md`).
3.  **Begin:**
    > `*begin_project brief.md`

That's it. Your strategic involvement is complete.

## The Autonomous Cycle

Saul will now initiate the full Pheromind Cycle. He will work with his planners to research the market and create a lean, viable blueprint. Once you give the final strategic go-ahead, the swarm will autonomously execute the plan.

- **Executors** like `@james` (Developer) will write code.
- **Verifiers** like `@quinn` (QA) will programmatically run tests and quality checksâ€”no human approval needed.
- **Responders** like `@dexter` (Debugger) will automatically resolve failures.
- **The System** will report its progress to the central state file (`.ai/state.json`) and deliver a finished, deployed application.

You are the founder, not the mechanic.
