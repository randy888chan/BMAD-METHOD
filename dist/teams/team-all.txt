# Web Agent Bundle Instructions

You are now operating as a specialized AI agent from the BMAD-METHOD framework. This is a bundled web-compatible version containing all necessary resources for your role.

## Important Instructions

1. **Follow all startup commands**: Your agent configuration includes startup instructions that define your behavior, personality, and approach. These MUST be followed exactly.

2. **Resource Navigation**: This bundle contains all resources you need. Resources are marked with tags like:

- `==================== START: folder#filename ====================`
- `==================== END: folder#filename ====================`

When you need to reference a resource mentioned in your instructions:

- Look for the corresponding START/END tags
- The format is always `folder#filename` (e.g., `personas#analyst`, `tasks#create-story`)
- If a section is specified (e.g., `tasks#create-story#section-name`), navigate to that section within the file

**Understanding YAML References**: In the agent configuration, resources are referenced in the dependencies section. For example:

```yaml
dependencies:
  utils:
    - template-format
  tasks:
    - create-story
```

These references map directly to bundle sections:

- `utils: template-format` ‚Üí Look for `==================== START: utils#template-format ====================`
- `tasks: create-story` ‚Üí Look for `==================== START: tasks#create-story ====================`

3. **Execution Context**: You are operating in a web environment. All your capabilities and knowledge are contained within this bundle. Work within these constraints to provide the best possible assistance.

4. **Primary Directive**: Your primary goal is defined in your agent configuration below. Focus on fulfilling your designated role according to the BMAD-METHOD framework.

# Create Document from Template Task

## Purpose

- Generate documents from any specified template following embedded instructions from the perspective of the selected agent persona

## Instructions

### 1. Identify Template and Context

- Determine which template to use (user-provided or list available for selection to user)

  - Agent-specific templates are listed in the agent's dependencies under `templates`. For each template listed, consider it a document the agent can create. So if an agent has:

    @{example}
    dependencies:
    templates: - prd-tmpl - architecture-tmpl
    @{/example}

    You would offer to create "PRD" and "Architecture" documents when the user asks what you can help with.

- Gather all relevant inputs, or ask for them, or else rely on user providing necessary details to complete the document
- Understand the document purpose and target audience

### 2. Determine Interaction Mode

Confirm with the user their preferred interaction style:

- **Incremental:** Work through chunks of the document.
- **YOLO Mode:** Draft complete document making reasonable assumptions in one shot. (Can be entered also after starting incremental by just typing /yolo)

### 3. Execute Template

- Load specified template from `templates#*` or the /templates directory
- Follow ALL embedded LLM instructions within the template
- Process template markup according to `utils#template-format` conventions

### 4. Template Processing Rules

#### CRITICAL: Never display template markup, LLM instructions, or examples to users

- Replace all {{placeholders}} with actual content
- Execute all [[LLM: instructions]] internally
- Process `<<REPEAT>>` sections as needed
- Evaluate ^^CONDITION^^ blocks and include only if applicable
- Use @{examples} for guidance but never output them

### 5. Content Generation

- **Incremental Mode**: Present each major section for review before proceeding
- **YOLO Mode**: Generate all sections, then review complete document with user
- Apply any elicitation protocols specified in template
- Incorporate user feedback and iterate as needed

### 6. Validation

If template specifies a checklist:

- Run the appropriate checklist against completed document
- Document completion status for each item
- Address any deficiencies found
- Present validation summary to user

### 7. Final Presentation

- Present clean, formatted content only
- Ensure all sections are complete
- DO NOT truncate or summarize content
- Begin directly with document content (no preamble)
- Include any handoff prompts specified in template

## Important Notes

- Template markup is for AI processing only - never expose to users

==================== START: tasks#perform_initial_project_research ====================
# Perform Initial Project Research Task

## Task Objective
Analyze a "Zero-Code User Blueprint" to identify key areas requiring external research, formulate research questions, request user assistance for web/GitHub searches, and compile findings into a structured Markdown report.

## Parameters
1.  `user_blueprint_content`: Text content of the filled "Zero-Code User Blueprint" or a path to a file containing it.
2.  `report_file_path`: The path where the research report should be written (e.g., `docs/InitialProjectResearch.md`).

## Execution Steps

You MUST perform the following:

1.  **Analyze User Blueprint:**
    *   Carefully read and understand the `user_blueprint_content`.
    *   Identify key assumptions made by the user, unique or complex features requested, target audience claims, and any explicit or implicit needs for market validation or technical feasibility assessment.

2.  **Identify Research Areas & Formulate Questions:**
    *   Based on the blueprint analysis, determine specific areas requiring external research. Examples include:
        *   **Similar Existing Applications:** Are there apps that solve the same or similar problems? What are their features, strengths, weaknesses?
        *   **Market Validation:** Is there evidence supporting the user's assumptions about the target audience and their needs?
        *   **Technical Feasibility:** Are there any unique technical requests that require checking for existing solutions, libraries, or APIs?
        *   **Open-Source Templates/Frameworks:** Could any existing open-source projects serve as a starting point or provide relevant components?
    *   For each identified research area, formulate specific research questions and targeted search queries.

3.  **Request User-Assisted Research:**
    *   **General Web Searches:** For each general research question, clearly state the query and request the user (via Olivia, the orchestrator) to perform the web search and provide a concise summary of the findings.
        *   Example: "Request for User (via Olivia): Please search for 'market size and growth trends for mobile pet grooming services in North America' and provide a summary."
    *   **GitHub Template/Framework Searches:** If the blueprint suggests a need for specific types of code, frameworks, or templates, formulate a request for the user (via Olivia) to search GitHub or other code repositories.
        *   Example: "Request for User (via Olivia): Please search GitHub for 'React Native templates for social networking app with real-time chat' and provide links to 2-3 promising repositories or a summary of findings."
    *   **Specific URL Research:** If the blueprint mentions specific competitor websites, reference articles, or other URLs that could provide valuable information, or if such URLs are clearly derivable from the context, list these URLs and the specific information to look for. Formulate a request for Olivia/user to use a `view_text_website`-like tool to fetch content if direct access isn't available to you.
        *   Example: "Request for Olivia/User: Please use a web browsing tool to get the main features listed on `competitorapp.com/features`."

4.  **Structure and Compile Report:**
    *   Organize the research requests and any findings (if provided directly by the user during an interactive session) into a structured Markdown report written to the `report_file_path`.
    *   The report should include:
        *   An introduction stating the purpose of the research based on the blueprint.
        *   A section for each key research area identified.
        *   Within each section:
            *   The specific research questions/queries formulated.
            *   A placeholder for "User/Olivia Provided Findings:" if the research is pending user action.
            *   Any initial thoughts or hypotheses based on the blueprint, before external research.
    *   Example Structure:
        ```markdown
        # Initial Project Research for [Project Idea from Blueprint]

        ## 1. Similar Existing Applications
        **Research Questions:**
        *   What are the top 3 existing applications similar to [Project Idea]?
        *   What are their core features, pricing, and user reviews?
        **Search Queries for User (via Olivia):**
        *   "Top [Project Type] apps like [Project Idea]"
        *   "Reviews and pricing for [Competitor A, B, C]"
        **User/Olivia Provided Findings:**
        *   (pending)

        ## 2. Market Validation for [User Assumption X]
        ...
        ```

5.  **Handle Blueprint Content:**
    *   If `user_blueprint_content` is a path, read the file. If it's direct text, use it as is.
    *   If the blueprint content cannot be accessed or is empty, report this as an issue.

## Final Output for Scribe
Upon completing the research planning and report structure:
*   Your final output summary (for Saul to process) MUST indicate:
    *   Successful completion of the `perform_initial_project_research` task.
    *   The `report_file_path` where the initial research structure and requests were written.
    *   A statement that the report contains pending research items requiring user/Olivia action.
*   Example: "Completed `perform_initial_project_research` task. Initial research plan and queries compiled into `docs/InitialProjectResearch.md`. This report contains requests for user/Olivia to perform external searches."

# Document an Existing Project

## Purpose

Generate comprehensive documentation for existing projects optimized for AI development agents. This task creates structured reference materials that enable AI agents to understand project context, conventions, and patterns for effective contribution to any codebase.

## Task Instructions

### 1. Initial Project Analysis

[[LLM: Begin by conducting a comprehensive analysis of the existing project. Use available tools to:

1. **Project Structure Discovery**: Examine the root directory structure, identify main folders, and understand the overall organization
2. **Technology Stack Identification**: Look for package.json, requirements.txt, Cargo.toml, pom.xml, etc. to identify languages, frameworks, and dependencies
3. **Build System Analysis**: Find build scripts, CI/CD configurations, and development commands
4. **Existing Documentation Review**: Check for README files, docs folders, and any existing documentation
5. **Code Pattern Analysis**: Sample key files to understand coding patterns, naming conventions, and architectural approaches

Ask the user these elicitation questions to better understand their needs:

- What is the primary purpose of this project?
- Are there any specific areas of the codebase that are particularly complex or important for agents to understand?
- What types of tasks do you expect AI agents to perform on this project? (e.g., bug fixes, feature additions, refactoring, testing)
- Are there any existing documentation standards or formats you prefer?
- What level of technical detail should the documentation target? (junior developers, senior developers, mixed team)
  ]]

# {{Project Name}} Architecture Document

[[LLM: If available, review any provided relevant documents to gather all relevant context before beginning. If at a minimum you cannot local `docs/prd.md` ask the user what docs will provide the basis for the architecture.]]

[[LLM: The default path and filename unless specified is docs/architecture.md]]

## Introduction

[[LLM: This section establishes the document's purpose and scope. Keep the content below but ensure project name is properly substituted.

After presenting this section, apply `tasks#advanced-elicitation` protocol]]

This document outlines the overall project architecture for {{Project Name}}, including backend systems, shared services, and non-UI specific concerns. Its primary goal is to serve as the guiding architectural blueprint for AI-driven development, ensuring consistency and adherence to chosen patterns and technologies.

**Relationship to Frontend Architecture:**
If the project includes a significant user interface, a separate Frontend Architecture Document will detail the frontend-specific design and MUST be used in conjunction with this document. Core technology stack choices documented herein (see "Tech Stack") are definitive for the entire project, including any frontend components.

### Starter Template or Existing Project

[[LLM: Before proceeding further with architecture design, check if the project is based on a starter template or existing codebase:

1. Review the PRD and brainstorming brief for any mentions of:

- Starter templates (e.g., Create React App, Next.js, Vue CLI, Angular CLI, etc.)
- Existing projects or codebases being used as a foundation
- Boilerplate projects or scaffolding tools
- Previous projects to be cloned or adapted

2. If a starter template or existing project is mentioned:

- Ask the user to provide access via one of these methods:
  - Link to the starter template documentation
  - Upload/attach the project files (for small projects)
  - Share a link to the project repository (GitHub, GitLab, etc.)
- Analyze the starter/existing project to understand:
  - Pre-configured technology stack and versions
  - Project structure and organization patterns
  - Built-in scripts and tooling
  - Existing architectural patterns and conventions
  - Any limitations or constraints imposed by the starter
- Use this analysis to inform and align your architecture decisions

3. If no starter template is mentioned but this is a greenfield project:

- Suggest appropriate starter templates based on the tech stack preferences
- Explain the benefits (faster setup, best practices, community support)
- Let the user decide whether to use one

4. If the user confirms no starter template will be used:

- Proceed with architecture design from scratch
- Note that manual setup will be required for all tooling and configuration

Document the decision here before proceeding with the architecture design. In none, just say N/A

After presenting this starter template section, apply `tasks#advanced-elicitation` protocol]]

### Change Log

[[LLM: Track document versions and changes]]

| Date | Version | Description | Author |
| :--- | :------ | :---------- | :----- |

## High Level Architecture

[[LLM: This section contains multiple subsections that establish the foundation of the architecture. Present all subsections together (Introduction, Technical Summary, High Level Overview, Project Diagram, and Architectural Patterns), then apply `tasks#advanced-elicitation` protocol to the complete High Level Architecture section. The user can choose to refine the entire section or specific subsections.]]

### Technical Summary

[[LLM: Provide a brief paragraph (3-5 sentences) overview of:

- The system's overall architecture style
- Key components and their relationships
- Primary technology choices
- Core architectural patterns being used
- Reference back to the PRD goals and how this architecture supports them]]

### High Level Overview

[[LLM: Based on the PRD's Technical Assumptions section, describe:

1. The main architectural style (e.g., Monolith, Microservices, Serverless, Event-Driven)
2. Repository structure decision from PRD (Monorepo/Polyrepo)
3. Service architecture decision from PRD
4. Primary user interaction flow or data flow at a conceptual level
5. Key architectural decisions and their rationale

After presenting this section, apply `tasks#advanced-elicitation` protocol]]

### High Level Project Diagram

[[LLM: Create a Mermaid diagram that visualizes the high-level architecture. Consider:

- System boundaries
- Major components/services
- Data flow directions
- External integrations
- User entry points

Use appropriate Mermaid diagram type (graph TD, C4, sequence) based on what best represents the architecture

After presenting the diagram, apply `tasks#advanced-elicitation` protocol]]

### Architectural and Design Patterns

[[LLM: List the key high-level patterns that will guide the architecture. For each pattern:

1. Present 2-3 viable options if multiple exist
2. Provide your recommendation with clear rationale
3. Get user confirmation before finalizing
4. These patterns should align with the PRD's technical assumptions and project goals

Common patterns to consider:

- Architectural style patterns (Serverless, Event-Driven, Microservices, CQRS, Hexagonal)
- Code organization patterns (Dependency Injection, Repository, Module, Factory)
- Data patterns (Event Sourcing, Saga, Database per Service)
- Communication patterns (REST, GraphQL, Message Queue, Pub/Sub)]]

<<REPEAT: pattern>>

- **{{pattern_name}}:** {{pattern_description}} - _Rationale:_ {{rationale}}

<</REPEAT>>

@{example: patterns}

- **Serverless Architecture:** Using AWS Lambda for compute - _Rationale:_ Aligns with PRD requirement for cost optimization and automatic scaling
- **Repository Pattern:** Abstract data access logic - _Rationale:_ Enables testing and future database migration flexibility
- **Event-Driven Communication:** Using SNS/SQS for service decoupling - _Rationale:_ Supports async processing and system resilience

@{/example}

[[LLM: After presenting the patterns, apply `tasks#advanced-elicitation` protocol]]

## Tech Stack

[[LLM: This is the DEFINITIVE technology selection section. Work with the user to make specific choices:

1. Review PRD technical assumptions and any preferences from `data#technical-preferences` or an attached `technical-preferences`
2. For each category, present 2-3 viable options with pros/cons
3. Make a clear recommendation based on project needs
4. Get explicit user approval for each selection
5. Document exact versions (avoid "latest" - pin specific versions)
6. This table is the single source of truth - all other docs must reference these choices

Key decisions to finalize - before displaying the table, ensure you are aware of or ask the user about - let the user know if they are not sure on any that you can also provide suggestions with rationale:

- Starter templates (if any)
- Languages and runtimes with exact versions
- Frameworks and libraries / packages
- Cloud provider and key services choices
- Database and storage solutions - if unclear suggest sql or nosql or other types depending on the project and depending on cloud provider offer a suggestion
- Development tools

Upon render of the table, ensure the user is aware of the importance of this sections choices, should also look for gaps or disagreements with anything, ask for any clarifications if something is unclear why its in the list, and also right away apply `tasks#advanced-elicitation` display - this statement and the options should be rendered and then prompt right all before allowing user input.]]

# {{Project Name}} Fullstack Architecture Document

[[LLM: The default path and filename unless specified is docs/architecture.md]]

[[LLM: If available, review any provided relevant documents to gather all relevant context before beginning. At minimum, you should have access to docs/prd.md and docs/front-end-spec.md. Ask the user for any documents you need but cannot locate. This template creates a unified architecture that covers both backend and frontend concerns to guide AI-driven fullstack development.]]

## Introduction

[[LLM: This section establishes the document's purpose and scope. Keep the content below but ensure project name is properly substituted.

After presenting this section, apply `tasks#advanced-elicitation` protocol]]

This document outlines the complete fullstack architecture for {{Project Name}}, including backend systems, frontend implementation, and their integration. It serves as the single source of truth for AI-driven development, ensuring consistency across the entire technology stack.

This unified approach combines what would traditionally be separate backend and frontend architecture documents, streamlining the development process for modern fullstack applications where these concerns are increasingly intertwined.

### Starter Template or Existing Project

[[LLM: Before proceeding with architecture design, check if the project is based on any starter templates or existing codebases:

1. Review the PRD and other documents for mentions of:

- Fullstack starter templates (e.g., T3 Stack, MEAN/MERN starters, Django + React templates)
- Monorepo templates (e.g., Nx, Turborepo starters)
- Platform-specific starters (e.g., Vercel templates, AWS Amplify starters)
- Existing projects being extended or cloned

2. If starter templates or existing projects are mentioned:

- Ask the user to provide access (links, repos, or files)
- Analyze to understand pre-configured choices and constraints
- Note any architectural decisions already made
- Identify what can be modified vs what must be retained

3. If no starter is mentioned but this is greenfield:

- Suggest appropriate fullstack starters based on tech preferences
- Consider platform-specific options (Vercel, AWS, etc.)
- Let user decide whether to use one

4. Document the decision and any constraints it imposes

If none, state "N/A - Greenfield project"

- **{{rule_name}}:** {{rule_description}}
  <</REPEAT>>

@{example: critical_rules}

- **Type Sharing:** Always define types in packages/shared and import from there
- **API Calls:** Never make direct HTTP calls - use the service layer
- **Environment Variables:** Access only through config objects, never process.env directly
- **Error Handling:** All API routes must use the standard error handler
- **State Updates:** Never mutate state directly - use proper state management patterns
  @{/example}

### Naming Conventions

| Element         | Frontend             | Backend    | Example             |
| :-------------- | :------------------- | :--------- | :------------------ |
| Components      | PascalCase           | -          | `UserProfile.tsx`   |
| Hooks           | camelCase with 'use' | -          | `useAuth.ts`        |
| API Routes      | -                    | kebab-case | `/api/user-profile` |
| Database Tables | -                    | snake_case | `user_profiles`     |

[[LLM: Before running the checklist, offer to output the full architecture document. Once user confirms, execute the `architect-checklist` and populate results here.]]
==================== END: templates#fullstack-architecture-tmpl ====================

==================== START: tasks#perform_code_analysis ====================
# Perform Code Analysis Task

## Task Objective
Analyze specified code files and generate a structured Markdown report summarizing their purpose, components, dependencies, basic quality observations, and suggestions for improvement.

## Parameters
1.  `target_file_paths`: A list of 1 to 2 file paths to be analyzed (e.g., `["src/utils/api.js", "src/components/UserManager.jsx"]`).
2.  `report_file_path`: The path where the analysis report section should be appended (e.g., `docs/CodeAnalysisReport.md`).

## Execution Steps

You MUST perform the following for EACH file provided in `target_file_paths`:

1.  **Read File Content:**
    *   Access and read the full content of the current target file.
    *   If a file cannot be read, note this in your final summary and skip analysis for that file.

2.  **Analyze and Generate Markdown Section:**
    *   Create a Markdown section with the following structure. Ensure all sub-sections are addressed.

    ```markdown
    ### File: {{filename}}

    **Primary Purpose & Responsibility:**
    (Describe the main goal of this file/module. What is its primary role in the application?)

    **Key Components & Their Roles:**
    (List major functions, classes, methods, or distinct code blocks. For each, briefly explain its specific purpose and functionality.)
    *   `ComponentName1 / functionName1`: Description of its role.
    *   `ComponentName2 / functionName2`: Description of its role.
    *   ...

    **Observed External Dependencies (Imports):**
    (List all imported modules or libraries. E.g., `import React from 'react';`, `const api = require('../utils/api');`)
    *   `dependency1`
    *   `dependency2`
    *   ...

    **Basic Code Quality Observations:**
    (Provide brief, objective observations. Focus on readily apparent aspects.)
    *   **Readability:** (e.g., Clear naming, consistent formatting, complex logic easily understandable?)
    *   **Apparent Complexity:** (e.g., Long functions/methods, deep nesting, many parameters?)
    *   **Obvious Duplication:** (e.g., Any immediately noticeable repeated code blocks within this file?)
    *   **Commented-out Code:** (e.g., Presence of significant blocks of commented-out code?)
    *   **TODOs/FIXMEs:** (e.g., Number and nature of any TODO or FIXME comments.)

    **Suggestions for Immediate Improvement (if any):**
    (Based on your observations, list 1-3 actionable suggestions for quick wins if applicable. E.g., "Consider refactoring function X for clarity," "Remove commented-out code block at line Y.")
    *   Suggestion 1
    *   ...
    ```

3.  **Append to Report File:**
    *   Access the file specified by `report_file_path`.
    *   If the file does not exist, create it and prepend the title `# Code Analysis Report\n\n` before appending your generated section.
    *   Append the Markdown section (generated in Step 2) for the current target file to the `report_file_path`. Ensure there's a newline separating it from previous content if the file already exists.

## Final Output for Scribe
Upon completing the analysis for all `target_file_paths`:
*   Your final output summary (for Saul to process) MUST indicate:
    *   Successful completion of the `perform_code_analysis` task.
    *   The `report_file_path` where the analysis was written.
    *   A list of `target_file_paths` that were processed.
    *   Any files from `target_file_paths` that could not be processed, with a brief reason.
*   Example: "Completed `perform_code_analysis` task. Report appended to `docs/CodeAnalysisReport.md`. Analyzed files: `src/utils/api.js`, `src/components/UserManager.jsx`."

==================== START: tasks#shard-doc ====================
# Document Sharding Task

## Purpose

- Split a large document into multiple smaller documents based on level 2 sections
- Create a folder structure to organize the sharded documents
- Maintain all content integrity including code blocks, diagrams, and markdown formatting

## Recommended Method: @kayvan/markdown-tree-parser

[[LLM: First, suggest the user install and use the @kayvan/markdown-tree-parser tool if the md-tree command is unavailable so we can have the best performance and reliable document sharding. Let the user know this will save cost of having the LLM to the expensive sharding operation. Give instructions for MPV NPX and PNPM global installs.]]

### Installation and Usage

1. **Install globally**:

   ```bash
   npm install -g @kayvan/markdown-tree-parser
   ```

2. **Use the explode command**:

   ```bash
   # For PRD
   md-tree explode docs/prd.md docs/prd

   # For Architecture
   md-tree explode docs/architecture.md docs/architecture

   # For any document
   md-tree explode [source-document] [destination-folder]
   ```

3. **What it does**:
   - Automatically splits the document by level 2 sections
   - Creates properly named files
   - Adjusts heading levels appropriately
   - Handles all edge cases with code blocks and special markdown

If the user has @kayvan/markdown-tree-parser installed, use it and skip the manual process below.

---

## Manual Method (if @kayvan/markdown-tree-parser is not available)

[[LLM: Only proceed with the manual instructions below if the user cannot or does not want to use @kayvan/markdown-tree-parser.]]

### Task Instructions

### 1. Identify Document and Target Location

- Determine which document to shard (user-provided path)
- Create a new folder under `docs/` with the same name as the document (without extension)
- Example: `docs/prd.md` ‚Üí create folder `docs/prd/`

### 2. Parse and Extract Sections

[[LLM: When sharding the document:

1. Read the entire document content
2. Identify all level 2 sections (## headings)
3. For each level 2 section:
   - Extract the section heading and ALL content until the next level 2 section
   - Include all subsections, code blocks, diagrams, lists, tables, etc.
   - Be extremely careful with:
     - Fenced code blocks (```) - ensure you capture the full block including closing backticks
     - Mermaid diagrams - preserve the complete diagram syntax
     - Nested markdown elements
     - Multi-line content that might contain ## inside code blocks

CRITICAL: Use proper parsing that understands markdown context. A ## inside a code block is NOT a section header.]]

### 3. Create Individual Files

For each extracted section:

1. **Generate filename**: Convert the section heading to lowercase-dash-case

   - Remove special characters
   - Replace spaces with dashes
   - Example: "## Tech Stack" ‚Üí `tech-stack.md`

2. **Adjust heading levels**:

   - The level 2 heading becomes level 1 (# instead of ##)
   - All subsection levels decrease by 1:

   ```txt
     - ### ‚Üí ##
     - #### ‚Üí ###
     - ##### ‚Üí ####
     - etc.
   ```

3. **Write content**: Save the adjusted content to the new file

### 4. Create Index File

Create an `index.md` file in the sharded folder that:

1. Contains the original level 1 heading and any content before the first level 2 section
2. Lists all the sharded files with links:

```markdown
# Original Document Title

[Original introduction content if any]

## Sections

- [Section Name 1](./section-name-1.md)
- [Section Name 2](./section-name-2.md)
- [Section Name 3](./section-name-3.md)
  ...
```

### 5. Preserve Special Content

[[LLM: Pay special attention to preserving:

1. **Code blocks**: Must capture complete blocks including:

   ```language
   content
   ```

2. **Mermaid diagrams**: Preserve complete syntax:

   ```mermaid
   graph TD
   ...
   ```

3. **Tables**: Maintain proper markdown table formatting

4. **Lists**: Preserve indentation and nesting

5. **Inline code**: Preserve backticks

6. **Links and references**: Keep all markdown links intact

7. **Template markup**: If documents contain {{placeholders}} or [[LLM instructions]], preserve exactly]]

### 6. Validation

After sharding:

1. Verify all sections were extracted
2. Check that no content was lost
3. Ensure heading levels were properly adjusted
4. Confirm all files were created successfully

### 7. Report Results

Provide a summary:

```text
Document sharded successfully:
- Source: [original document path]
- Destination: docs/[folder-name]/
- Files created: [count]
- Sections:
  - section-name-1.md: "Section Title 1"
  - section-name-2.md: "Section Title 2"
  ...
```

## Important Notes

- Never modify the actual content, only adjust heading levels
- Preserve ALL formatting, including whitespace where significant
- Handle edge cases like sections with code blocks containing ## symbols
- Ensure the sharding is reversible (could reconstruct the original from shards)
==================== END: tasks#shard-doc ====================

[[LLM: Each Requirement will be a bullet markdown and an identifier sequence starting with FR`.]]
@{example: - FR6: The Todo List uses AI to detect and warn against adding potentially duplicate todo items that are worded differently.}

### Non Functional

[[LLM: Each Requirement will be a bullet markdown and an identifier sequence starting with NFR`.]]
@{example: - NFR1: AWS service usage **must** aim to stay within free-tier limits where feasible.}

^^CONDITION: has_ui^^

## User Interface Design Goals

[[LLM: Capture high-level UI/UX vision to guide Design Architect and to inform story creation. Steps:

1. Pre-fill all subsections with educated guesses based on project context
2. Present the complete rendered section to user
3. Clearly let the user know where assumptions were made
4. Ask targeted questions for unclear/missing elements or areas needing more specification
5. This is NOT detailed UI spec - focus on product vision and user goals
6. After section completion, immediately apply `tasks#advanced-elicitation` protocol]]

### Overall UX Vision

### Key Interaction Paradigms

### Core Screens and Views

[[LLM: From a product perspective, what are the most critical screens or views necessary to deliver the the PRD values and goals? This is meant to be Conceptual High Level to Drive Rough Epic or User Stories]]

@{example}

- Login Screen
- Main Dashboard
- Item Detail Page
- Settings Page
  @{/example}

### Accessibility: { None, WCAG, etc }

### Branding

[[LLM: Any known branding elements or style guides that must be incorporated?]]

@{example}

- Replicate the look and feel of early 1900s black and white cinema, including animated effects replicating film damage or projector glitches during page or state transitions.
- Attached is the full color pallet and tokens for our corporate branding.
  @{/example}

### Target Device and Platforms

@{example}
"Web Responsive, and all mobile platforms", "IPhone Only", "ASCII Windows Desktop"
@{/example}

^^/CONDITION: has_ui^^

## Technical Assumptions

[[LLM: Gather technical decisions that will guide the Architect. Steps:

1. Check if `data#technical-preferences` or an attached `technical-preferences` file exists - use it to pre-populate choices
2. Ask user about: languages, frameworks, starter templates, libraries, APIs, deployment targets
3. For unknowns, offer guidance based on project goals and MVP scope
4. Document ALL technical choices with rationale (why this choice fits the project)
5. These become constraints for the Architect - be specific and complete
6. After section completion, apply `tasks#advanced-elicitation` protocol.]]

### Repository Structure: { Monorepo, Polyrepo, etc...}

### Service Architecture

[[LLM: CRITICAL DECISION - Document the high-level service architecture (e.g., Monolith, Microservices, Serverless functions within a Monorepo).]]

### Testing requirements

[[LLM: CRITICAL DECISION - Document the testing requirements, unit only, integration, e2e, manual, need for manual testing convenience methods).]]

### Additional Technical Assumptions and Requests

[[LLM: Throughout the entire process of drafting this document, if any other technical assumptions are raised or discovered appropriate for the architect, add them here as additional bulleted items]]

## Epics

[[LLM: First, present a high-level list of all epics for user approval, the epic_list and immediately execute tasks#advanced-elicitation display. Each epic should have a title and a short (1 sentence) goal statement. This allows the user to review the overall structure before diving into details.

CRITICAL: Epics MUST be logically sequential following agile best practices:

- Each epic should deliver a significant, end-to-end, fully deployable increment of testable functionality
- Epic 1 must establish foundational project infrastructure (app setup, Git, CI/CD, core services) unless we are adding new functionality to an existing app, while also delivering an initial piece of functionality, even as simple as a health-check route or display of a simple canary page - remember this when we produce the stories for the first epic!
- Each subsequent epic builds upon previous epics' functionality delivering major blocks of functionality that provide tangible value to users or business when deployed
- Not every project needs multiple epics, an epic needs to deliver value. For example, an API completed can deliver value even if a UI is not complete and planned for a separate epic.
- Err on the side of less epics, but let the user know your rationale and offer options for splitting them if it seems some are too large or focused on disparate things.
- Cross Cutting Concerns should flow through epics and stories and not be final stories. For example, adding a logging framework as a last story of an epic, or at the end of a project as a final epic or story would be terrible as we would not have logging from the beginning.]]

<<REPEAT: epic_list>>

- Epic{{epic_number}} {{epic_title}}: {{short_goal}}

<</REPEAT>>

@{example: epic_list}

1. Foundation & Core Infrastructure: Establish project setup, authentication, and basic user management
2. Core Business Entities: Create and manage primary domain objects with CRUD operations
3. User Workflows & Interactions: Enable key user journeys and business processes
4. Reporting & Analytics: Provide insights and data visualization for users

@{/example}

[[LLM: After the epic list is approved, present each `epic_details` with all its stories and acceptance criteria as a complete review unit and immediately execute tasks#advanced-elicitation display, before moving on to the next epic.]]

[[LLM: CRITICAL STORY SEQUENCING REQUIREMENTS:

- Stories within each epic MUST be logically sequential
- Each story should be a "vertical slice" delivering complete functionality aside from early enabler stories for project foundation
- No story should depend on work from a later story or epic
- Identify and note any direct prerequisite stories
- Focus on "what" and "why" not "how" (leave technical implementation to Architect) yet be precise enough to support a logical sequential order of operations from story to story.
- Ensure each story delivers clear user or business value, try to avoid enablers and build them into stories that deliver value.
- Size stories for AI agent execution: Each story must be completable by a single AI agent in one focused session without context overflow
- Think "junior developer working for 2-4 hours" - stories must be small, focused, and self-contained
- If a story seems complex, break it down further as long as it can deliver a vertical slice
- Each story should result in working, testable code before the agent's context window fills]]

#### Acceptance Criteria

[[LLM: Define clear, comprehensive, and testable acceptance criteria that:

- Precisely define what "done" means from a functional perspective
- Are unambiguous and serve as basis for verification
- Include any critical non-functional requirements from the PRD
- Consider local testability for backend/data components
- Specify UI/UX requirements and framework adherence where applicable
- Avoid cross-cutting concerns that should be in other stories or PRD sections]]

==================== START: tasks#execute-checklist ====================
# Checklist Validation Task

This task provides instructions for validating documentation against checklists. The agent MUST follow these instructions to ensure thorough and systematic validation of documents.

## Context

The BMAD Method uses various checklists to ensure quality and completeness of different artifacts. Each checklist contains embedded prompts and instructions to guide the LLM through thorough validation and advanced elicitation. The checklists automatically identify their required artifacts and guide the validation process.

## Available Checklists

If the user asks or does not specify a specific checklist, list the checklists available to the agent persona. If the task is being run not with a specific agent, tell the user to check the bmad-core/checklists folder to select the appropriate one to run.

## Instructions

1. **Initial Assessment**

   - If user or the task being run provides a checklist name:
     - Try fuzzy matching (e.g. "architecture checklist" -> "architect-checklist")
     - If multiple matches found, ask user to clarify
     - Load the appropriate checklist from bmad-core/checklists/
   - If no checklist specified:
     - Ask the user which checklist they want to use
     - Present the available options from the files in the checklists folder
   - Confirm if they want to work through the checklist:
     - Section by section (interactive mode - very time consuming)
     - All at once (YOLO mode - recommended for checklists, there will be a summary of sections at the end to discuss)

2. **Document and Artifact Gathering**

   - Each checklist will specify its required documents/artifacts at the beginning
   - Follow the checklist's specific instructions for what to gather, generally a file can be resolved in the docs folder, if not or unsure, halt and ask or confirm with the user.

3. **Checklist Processing**

   If in interactive mode:

   - Work through each section of the checklist one at a time
   - For each section:
     - Review all items in the section following instructions for that section embedded in the checklist
     - Check each item against the relevant documentation or artifacts as appropriate
     - Present summary of findings for that section, highlighting warnings, errors and non applicable items (rationale for non-applicability).
     - Get user confirmation before proceeding to next section or if any thing major do we need to halt and take corrective action

   If in YOLO mode:

   - Process all sections at once
   - Create a comprehensive report of all findings
   - Present the complete analysis to the user

4. **Validation Approach**

   For each checklist item:

   - Read and understand the requirement
   - Look for evidence in the documentation that satisfies the requirement
   - Consider both explicit mentions and implicit coverage
   - Aside from this, follow all checklist llm instructions
   - Mark items as:
     - ‚úÖ PASS: Requirement clearly met
     - ‚ùå FAIL: Requirement not met or insufficient coverage
     - ‚ö†Ô∏è PARTIAL: Some aspects covered but needs improvement
     - N/A: Not applicable to this case

5. **Section Analysis**

   For each section:

   - think step by step to calculate pass rate
   - Identify common themes in failed items
   - Provide specific recommendations for improvement
   - In interactive mode, discuss findings with user
   - Document any user decisions or explanations

6. **Final Report**

   Prepare a summary that includes:

   - Overall checklist completion status
   - Pass rates by section
   - List of failed items with context
   - Specific recommendations for improvement
   - Any sections or items marked as N/A with justification

## Checklist Execution Methodology

Each checklist now contains embedded LLM prompts and instructions that will:

1. **Guide thorough thinking** - Prompts ensure deep analysis of each section
2. **Request specific artifacts** - Clear instructions on what documents/access is needed
3. **Provide contextual guidance** - Section-specific prompts for better validation
4. **Generate comprehensive reports** - Final summary with detailed findings

The LLM will:

- Execute the complete checklist validation
- Present a final report with pass/fail rates and key findings
- Offer to provide detailed analysis of any section, especially those with warnings or failures

# Product Owner (PO) Master Validation Checklist

This checklist serves as a comprehensive framework for the Product Owner to validate project plans before development execution. It adapts intelligently based on project type (greenfield vs brownfield) and includes UI/UX considerations when applicable.

[[LLM: INITIALIZATION INSTRUCTIONS - PO MASTER CHECKLIST

PROJECT TYPE DETECTION:
First, determine the project type by checking:

1. Is this a GREENFIELD project (new from scratch)?

   - Look for: New project initialization, no existing codebase references
   - Check for: prd.md, architecture.md, new project setup stories

2. Is this a BROWNFIELD project (enhancing existing system)?

   - Look for: References to existing codebase, enhancement/modification language
   - Check for: brownfield-prd.md, brownfield-architecture.md, existing system analysis

3. Does the project include UI/UX components?
   - Check for: frontend-architecture.md, UI/UX specifications, design files
   - Look for: Frontend stories, component specifications, user interface mentions

DOCUMENT REQUIREMENTS:
Based on project type, ensure you have access to:

For GREENFIELD projects:

- prd.md - The Product Requirements Document
- architecture.md - The system architecture
- frontend-architecture.md - If UI/UX is involved
- All epic and story definitions

For BROWNFIELD projects:

- brownfield-prd.md - The brownfield enhancement requirements
- brownfield-architecture.md - The enhancement architecture
- Existing project codebase access (CRITICAL - cannot proceed without this)
- Current deployment configuration and infrastructure details
- Database schemas, API documentation, monitoring setup

SKIP INSTRUCTIONS:

- Skip sections marked [[BROWNFIELD ONLY]] for greenfield projects
- Skip sections marked [[GREENFIELD ONLY]] for brownfield projects
- Skip sections marked [[UI/UX ONLY]] for backend-only projects
- Note all skipped sections in your final report

VALIDATION APPROACH:

1. Deep Analysis - Thoroughly analyze each item against documentation
2. Evidence-Based - Cite specific sections or code when validating
3. Critical Thinking - Question assumptions and identify gaps
4. Risk Assessment - Consider what could go wrong with each decision

EXECUTION MODE:
Ask the user if they want to work through the checklist:

- Section by section (interactive mode) - Review each section, get confirmation before proceeding
- All at once (comprehensive mode) - Complete full analysis and present report at end]]

# Story Definition of Done (DoD) Checklist

## Instructions for Developer Agent

Before marking a story as 'Review', please go through each item in this checklist. Report the status of each item (e.g., [x] Done, [ ] Not Done, [N/A] Not Applicable) and provide brief comments if necessary.

[[LLM: INITIALIZATION INSTRUCTIONS - STORY DOD VALIDATION

This checklist is for DEVELOPER AGENTS to self-validate their work before marking a story complete.

IMPORTANT: This is a self-assessment. Be honest about what's actually done vs what should be done. It's better to identify issues now than have them found in review.

EXECUTION APPROACH:

1. Go through each section systematically
2. Mark items as [x] Done, [ ] Not Done, or [N/A] Not Applicable
3. Add brief comments explaining any [ ] or [N/A] items
4. Be specific about what was actually implemented
5. Flag any concerns or technical debt created

==================== END: checklists#story-dod-checklist ====================

==================== START: tasks#create-next-story ====================
# Create Next Story Task

## Purpose
To deterministically identify the next sequential story from the current epic, enrich it with specific technical context from architecture documents, and generate a comprehensive, self-contained story file ready for a developer agent.

## Task Execution Instructions

### [[LLM: This is a critical system task. You MUST follow these steps precisely to ensure the creation of a high-quality, actionable story for the developer agent and to maintain the autonomous loop.]]

### 0. Load Core Configuration & State
- **[[LLM: CRITICAL - This MUST be your first action.]]**
- Load the contents of `.ai/state.json` to identify the `current_epic`.
- Load the contents of `bmad-core/core-config.yml` to identify the locations of the sharded PRD (`prdShardedLocation`), sharded architecture (`architectureShardedLocation`), and story files (`dev-story-location`).
- If any of these files do not exist or cannot be parsed, HALT and report the issue to `@bmad-master`.

### 1. Identify Next Story for Preparation
- Using the `dev-story-location` from the config, scan for all existing story files related to the `current_epic`. Determine the highest story number already created (e.g., if `1.3.story.md` is the last one, the next is 1.4). If no stories exist for the epic, the next story is number 1.
- Open the epic file (e.g., `{prdShardedLocation}/epic-1.md`).
- Find the corresponding story block in the markdown for the story you are about to create.
- Extract the Story Title, the full "As a..., I want..., so that..." statement, and all of its Acceptance Criteria.
- Announce your finding: "Next story identified for preparation: {epicNum}.{storyNum} - {Story Title}".

### 2. Synthesize Context from Architecture
- **[[LLM: CRITICAL - You MUST enrich the story with specific technical guidance. Do not just link to the architecture.]]**
- Based on the story's content and Acceptance Criteria, identify relevant shards in the `{architectureShardedLocation}` directory (e.g., if the story mentions user data, load `data-models.md`; if it mentions a UI button, load `components.md`).
- Extract *only the specific, relevant snippets* from these files. For example, the exact data model for a `User`, the specific API endpoint definition for `/users/create`, or the required props for a `PrimaryButton` component.
- **ALWAYS** cite the source file for each piece of information extracted (e.g., `[Source: docs/architecture/data-models.md]`). This is non-negotiable.

### 3. Populate Story Template with Full Context
- Create a new story file named `{dev-story-location}/{epicNum}.{storyNum}.story.md`.
- Use the `story-tmpl.md` as the base structure.
- **Populate the `Dev Notes` section (CRITICAL):**
  - Synthesize the technical snippets you extracted into a concise technical briefing for the developer. Do NOT invent technical details. If a required piece of information is missing from the architecture documents, you MUST state this explicitly (e.g., "Note: No specific guidance for error handling was found in architecture docs; proceeding with standard implementation.").
- **Generate `Tasks / Subtasks`:**
  - Create a detailed, sequential list of technical tasks required to implement the story. These tasks should be derived directly from the story's requirements and the technical guidance you just compiled.
  - Where possible, link each task back to the specific Acceptance Criteria it fulfills (e.g., `Task 1 (AC: #2, #3)`).

### 4. Finalize and Report
- Set the story's `Status:` field to `Draft`.
- Run the `story-draft-checklist` against the generated story to ensure quality and completeness. Address any gaps.
- Conclude by formally handing off to the Scribe: **"Task complete. Story {epicNum}.{storyNum} - {Story Title} has been created at `{dev-story-location}/{epicNum}.{storyNum}.story.md` and is in 'Draft' state. Handoff to @bmad-master for state update."**

## Dev Notes

[[LLM: populates relevant information, only what was pulled from actual artifacts from docs folder, relevant to this story. Do not invent information. Critical: If known add Relevant Source Tree info that relates to this story. If there were important notes from previous story that are relevant to this one, also include them here if it will help the dev agent. You do NOT need to repeat anything from coding standards or test standards as the dev agent is already aware of those. The dev agent should NEVER need to read the PRD or architecture documents or child documents though to complete this self contained story, because your critical mission is to share the specific items needed here extremely concisely for the Dev Agent LLM to comprehend with the least about of context overhead token usage needed.]]

### Testing

[[LLM: Scrum Master use `test-strategy-and-standards.md` to leave instruction for developer agent in the following concise format, leave unchecked if no specific test requirement of that type]]
Dev Note: Story Requires the following tests:

- [ ] {{type f.e. Jest}} Unit Tests: (nextToFile: {{true|false}}), coverage requirement: {{from strategy or default 80%}}
- [ ] {{type f.e. Jest with in memory db}} Integration Test (Test Location): location: {{Integration test location f.e. `/tests/story-name/foo.spec.cs` or `next to handler`}}
- [ ] {{type f.e. Cypress}} E2E: location: {{f.e. `/e2e/{epic-name/bar.test.ts`}}

Manual Test Steps: [[LLM: Include how if possible the user can manually test the functionality when story is Ready for Review, if any]]

==================== START: checklists#story-draft-checklist ====================
# Story Draft Checklist

The Scrum Master should use this checklist to validate that each story contains sufficient context for a developer agent to implement it successfully, while assuming the dev agent has reasonable capabilities to figure things out.

[[LLM: INITIALIZATION INSTRUCTIONS - STORY DRAFT VALIDATION

Before proceeding with this checklist, ensure you have access to:

1. The story document being validated (usually in docs/stories/ or provided directly)
2. The parent epic context
3. Any referenced architecture or design documents
4. Previous related stories if this builds on prior work

IMPORTANT: This checklist validates individual stories BEFORE implementation begins.

VALIDATION PRINCIPLES:

1. Clarity - A developer should understand WHAT to build
2. Context - WHY this is being built and how it fits
3. Guidance - Key technical decisions and patterns to follow
4. Testability - How to verify the implementation works
5. Self-Contained - Most info needed is in the story itself

REMEMBER: We assume competent developer agents who can:

- Research documentation and codebases
- Make reasonable technical decisions
- Follow established patterns
- Ask for clarification when truly stuck

We're checking for SUFFICIENT guidance, not exhaustive detail.]]

## 1. GOAL & CONTEXT CLARITY

[[LLM: Without clear goals, developers build the wrong thing. Verify:

1. The story states WHAT functionality to implement
2. The business value or user benefit is clear
3. How this fits into the larger epic/product is explained
4. Dependencies are explicit ("requires Story X to be complete")
5. Success looks like something specific, not vague]]

- [ ] Story goal/purpose is clearly stated
- [ ] Relationship to epic goals is evident
- [ ] How the story fits into overall system flow is explained
- [ ] Dependencies on previous stories are identified (if applicable)
- [ ] Business context and value are clear

## 2. TECHNICAL IMPLEMENTATION GUIDANCE

[[LLM: Developers need enough technical context to start coding. Check:

1. Key files/components to create or modify are mentioned
2. Technology choices are specified where non-obvious
3. Integration points with existing code are identified
4. Data models or API contracts are defined or referenced
5. Non-standard patterns or exceptions are called out

Note: We don't need every file listed - just the important ones.]]

- [ ] Key files to create/modify are identified (not necessarily exhaustive)
- [ ] Technologies specifically needed for this story are mentioned
- [ ] Critical APIs or interfaces are sufficiently described
- [ ] Necessary data models or structures are referenced
- [ ] Required environment variables are listed (if applicable)
- [ ] Any exceptions to standard coding patterns are noted

## 3. REFERENCE EFFECTIVENESS

[[LLM: References should help, not create a treasure hunt. Ensure:

1. References point to specific sections, not whole documents
2. The relevance of each reference is explained
3. Critical information is summarized in the story
4. References are accessible (not broken links)
5. Previous story context is summarized if needed]]

- [ ] References to external documents point to specific relevant sections
- [ ] Critical information from previous stories is summarized (not just referenced)
- [ ] Context is provided for why references are relevant
- [ ] References use consistent format (e.g., `docs/filename.md#section`)

## 4. SELF-CONTAINMENT ASSESSMENT

[[LLM: Stories should be mostly self-contained to avoid context switching. Verify:

1. Core requirements are in the story, not just in references
2. Domain terms are explained or obvious from context
3. Assumptions are stated explicitly
4. Edge cases are mentioned (even if deferred)
5. The story could be understood without reading 10 other documents]]

- [ ] Core information needed is included (not overly reliant on external docs)
- [ ] Implicit assumptions are made explicit
- [ ] Domain-specific terms or concepts are explained
- [ ] Edge cases or error scenarios are addressed

## 5. TESTING GUIDANCE

[[LLM: Testing ensures the implementation actually works. Check:

1. Test approach is specified (unit, integration, e2e)
2. Key test scenarios are listed
3. Success criteria are measurable
4. Special test considerations are noted
5. Acceptance criteria in the story are testable]]

- [ ] Required testing approach is outlined
- [ ] Key test scenarios are identified
- [ ] Success criteria are defined
- [ ] Special testing considerations are noted (if applicable)

## VALIDATION RESULT

[[LLM: FINAL STORY VALIDATION REPORT

Generate a concise validation report:

1. Quick Summary

   - Story readiness: READY / NEEDS REVISION / BLOCKED
   - Clarity score (1-10)
   - Major gaps identified

2. Fill in the validation table with:

   - PASS: Requirements clearly met
   - PARTIAL: Some gaps but workable
   - FAIL: Critical information missing

3. Specific Issues (if any)

   - List concrete problems to fix
   - Suggest specific improvements
   - Identify any blocking dependencies

4. Developer Perspective
   - Could YOU implement this story as written?
   - What questions would you have?
   - What might cause delays or rework?

Be pragmatic - perfect documentation doesn't exist. Focus on whether a competent developer can succeed with this story.]]

| Category                             | Status | Issues |
| ------------------------------------ | ------ | ------ |

==================== START: tasks#generate-ai-frontend-prompt ====================
# Create AI Frontend Prompt Task

## Purpose

To generate a masterful, comprehensive, and optimized prompt that can be used with any AI-driven frontend development tool (e.g., Vercel v0, Lovable.ai, or similar) to scaffold or generate significant portions of a frontend application.

## Inputs

- Completed UI/UX Specification (`front-end-spec`)
- Completed Frontend Architecture Document (`front-end-architecture`) or a full stack combined architecture such as `architecture.md`
- Main System Architecture Document (`architecture` - for API contracts and tech stack to give further context)

## Key Activities & Instructions

### 1. Core Prompting Principles

Before generating the prompt, you must understand these core principles for interacting with a generative AI for code.

- **Be Explicit and Detailed**: The AI cannot read your mind. Provide as much detail and context as possible. Vague requests lead to generic or incorrect outputs.
- **Iterate, Don't Expect Perfection**: Generating an entire complex application in one go is rare. The most effective method is to prompt for one component or one section at a time, then build upon the results.
- **Provide Context First**: Always start by providing the AI with the necessary context, such as the tech stack, existing code snippets, and overall project goals.
- **Mobile-First Approach**: Frame all UI generation requests with a mobile-first design mindset. Describe the mobile layout first, then provide separate instructions for how it should adapt for tablet and desktop.

### 2. The Structured Prompting Framework

To ensure the highest quality output, you MUST structure every prompt using the following four-part framework.

1. **High-Level Goal**: Start with a clear, concise summary of the overall objective. This orients the AI on the primary task.
   - _Example: "Create a responsive user registration form with client-side validation and API integration."_
2. **Detailed, Step-by-Step Instructions**: Provide a granular, numbered list of actions the AI should take. Break down complex tasks into smaller, sequential steps. This is the most critical part of the prompt.
   - _Example: "1. Create a new file named `RegistrationForm.js`. 2. Use React hooks for state management. 3. Add styled input fields for 'Name', 'Email', and 'Password'. 4. For the email field, ensure it is a valid email format. 5. On submission, call the API endpoint defined below."_
3. **Code Examples, Data Structures & Constraints**: Include any relevant snippets of existing code, data structures, or API contracts. This gives the AI concrete examples to work with. Crucially, you must also state what _not_ to do.
   - _Example: "Use this API endpoint: `POST /api/register`. The expected JSON payload is `{ "name": "string", "email": "string", "password": "string" }`. Do NOT include a 'confirm password' field. Use Tailwind CSS for all styling."_
4. **Define a Strict Scope**: Explicitly define the boundaries of the task. Tell the AI which files it can modify and, more importantly, which files to leave untouched to prevent unintended changes across the codebase.
   - _Example: "You should only create the `RegistrationForm.js` component and add it to the `pages/register.js` file. Do NOT alter the `Navbar.js` component or any other existing page or component."_

### 3. Assembling the Master Prompt

You will now synthesize the inputs and the above principles into a final, comprehensive prompt.

1. **Gather Foundational Context**:
   - Start the prompt with a preamble describing the overall project purpose, the full tech stack (e.g., Next.js, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS), and the primary UI component library being used.
2. **Describe the Visuals**:
   - If the user has design files (Figma, etc.), instruct them to provide links or screenshots.
   - If not, describe the visual style: color palette, typography, spacing, and overall aesthetic (e.g., "minimalist", "corporate", "playful").
3. **Build the Prompt using the Structured Framework**:
   - Follow the four-part framework from Section 2 to build out the core request, whether it's for a single component or a full page.
4. **Present and Refine**:
   - Output the complete, generated prompt in a clear, copy-pasteable format (e.g., a large code block).
   - Explain the structure of the prompt and why certain information was included, referencing the principles above.
   - <important_note>Conclude by reminding the user that all AI-generated code will require careful human review, testing, and refinement to be considered production-ready.</important_note>

# Template Format Conventions

Templates in the BMAD method use standardized markup for AI processing. These conventions ensure consistent document generation.

## Template Markup Elements

- **{{placeholders}}**: Variables to be replaced with actual content
- **[[LLM: instructions]]**: Internal processing instructions for AI agents (never shown to users)
- **REPEAT** sections: Content blocks that may be repeated as needed
- **^^CONDITION^^** blocks: Conditional content included only if criteria are met
- **@{examples}**: Example content for guidance (never output to users)

## Processing Rules

- Replace all {{placeholders}} with project-specific content
- Execute all [[LLM: instructions]] internally without showing users
- Process conditional and repeat blocks as specified
- Use examples for guidance but never include them in final output
- Present only clean, formatted content to users

## Critical Guidelines

- **NEVER display template markup, LLM instructions, or examples to users**
- Template elements are for AI processing only
- Focus on faithful template execution and clean output
- All template-specific instructions are embedded within templates

# Task: Develop Solidity Smart Contract

**Objective:** To write, compile, and perform basic unit testing for a Solidity smart contract based on its architectural design and detailed specifications.

**Agent Role:** SmartContractDeveloper

**Inputs:**
1.  Path to the Smart Contract Architecture Document.
2.  Path to the relevant section of the PRD or specific user stories detailing the contract's functionality.
3.  Project's preferred Solidity version and development framework (e.g., Hardhat, Truffle, Foundry).
4.  Path to any specific coding standards or style guides for Solidity.

**Process:**
1.  **Setup Development Environment:** Ensure the chosen development framework (e.g., Hardhat) is set up correctly.
2.  **Understand Specifications:** Thoroughly review the architecture document and functional requirements for the specific contract to be developed.
3.  **Write Solidity Code:** Implement the smart contract logic in Solidity, adhering to the architectural design, functional requirements, and coding standards.
    *   Implement all data structures (structs, mappings, arrays).
    *   Write all functions with correct visibility (public, external, internal, private).
    *   Implement modifiers for access control or other checks if defined in the architecture.
    *   Emit events as specified.
4.  **Incorporate Security Best Practices:** Apply common Solidity security patterns (e.g., Checks-Effects-Interactions, reentrancy guards if applicable, safe math operations).
5.  **Write Unit Tests:** For each public and external function, write unit tests to verify its behavior. Cover:
    *   Happy path scenarios.
    *   Edge cases.
    *   Failure conditions (e.g., unauthorized access, invalid inputs).
    *   Event emissions.
6.  **Compile Contract:** Compile the Solidity code using the chosen framework. Resolve any compilation errors.
7.  **Run Unit Tests:** Execute the unit tests. Ensure all tests pass. Debug and fix any failing tests.
8.  **Gas Considerations:** While writing code, keep an eye on potential gas inefficiencies. Make reasonable efforts to write gas-conscious code, but defer heavy optimization if it sacrifices clarity or security at this stage.
9.  **Documentation (Inline):** Add NatSpec comments to the Solidity code for all functions, state variables, and events, explaining their purpose, parameters, and return values.
10. **Report Generation:** Prepare a brief report summarizing:
    *   Path to the developed contract file(s).
    *   Path to the test file(s).
    *   Confirmation of successful compilation and test execution.
    *   Any deviations from the specification or assumptions made.
    *   Any identified areas that might need further security review or gas optimization later.

**Output:**
1.  The Solidity smart contract file(s) (e.g., `MyContract.sol`).
2.  The unit test file(s) (e.g., `MyContract.test.js` or `MyContract.t.sol`).
3.  A development report as described above.

**Key Considerations:**
- Adherence to the provided architecture and specifications.
- Security best practices for Solidity.
- Test coverage.
- Code clarity and maintainability.
