# Pheromind: The Autonomous AI Development Swarm

Pheromind is a revolutionary framework for orchestrating a swarm of specialized AI agents to autonomously build software. It moves beyond simple scripting to a model of **True Autonomous Orchestration**, where a central intelligence plans, executes, and learns with minimal human intervention.

At its core, the system utilizes:

-   **Stigmergic Coordination:** Agents interact indirectly by leaving "digital pheromones" in a shared state file (`.ai/state.json`), enabling complex, coordinated behavior without direct communication.
-   **State-Driven Autonomous Cycle:** A single, intelligent orchestrator manages the entire project lifecycleâ€”from planning and architecture to coding, verification, and self-improvementâ€”by interpreting and reacting to the system's state.
-   **AI-Verifiable Outcomes:** Progress is measured by concrete, programmatically-confirmable outputs against a master project manifest and quality protocols.
-   **Constitutional AI:** All agents operate under a shared set of core principles (`.stigmergy-core/system_docs/03_Core_Principles.md`), ensuring consistent, predictable, and trustworthy behavior.

## The Pheromind Cycle: The Path to Autonomy

1.  **Initiation:** In your IDE, activate the Chief Orchestrator, **`@stigmergy-master` (Saul)**.
2.  **Directive:** Give Saul a high-level project goal in a simple text file (e.g., `goal.txt`).
3.  **Set Autonomy:** For a hands-free experience, give Saul the command:
    > `*set_autonomy autonomous`
4.  **Begin:**
    > `*begin_project goal.txt`
5.  **Autonomous Orchestration:** Saul will now initiate the full Pheromind Cycle. He will dispatch planners to create a detailed blueprint and a master `project_manifest`. From there, he will manage the entire execution and self-improvement loop without further intervention, unless you choose to step in. The system is a "glass box," allowing for human oversight and course correction.

## Agent Archetypes

The swarm is composed of specialized agents, each with a clear role, operating under a strict chain of command dispatched by the Chief Orchestrator.

| Agent ID                  | Name (Archetype)                     | Core Responsibilities                                                               |
| ------------------------- | ------------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **`@stigmergy-master`**   | **Saul (Chief Orchestrator)**        | The master brain. Interprets goals and system state to direct the swarm through the entire lifecycle. |
| `@analyst`, `@pm`, `@architect` | **(Planners)** Mary, John, Winston | Create the project blueprint (`docs/`) and `project_manifest` under Saul's direction. |
| **`@stigmergy-orchestrator`** | **(Execution Coordinator)** Olivia   | Manages the micro-level `dev->qa->po` loop for a single story. A subordinate of Saul. |
| `@dev`, `@victor`         | **(Executors)** James, Victor        | Write code to implement sub-tasks assigned by Olivia.                               |
| `@qa`, `@po`              | **(Verifiers)** Quinn, Sarah         | Ensure quality, standards compliance, and alignment with the blueprint.           |
| `@debugger`               | **(Adaptive Responder)** Dexter      | Diagnoses and proposes solutions for complex failures logged in the state file.       |
| `@meta`                   | **(Adaptive Responder)** Metis       | Analyzes swarm performance and proposes concrete improvements to the system itself. |
