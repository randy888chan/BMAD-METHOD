# Story Implementation Expansion Pack

## Overview
Comprehensive end-to-end story implementation workflows with dual-variant approach, extensive validation systems, and intelligent learning extraction. Transforms epic context into production-ready deliverables with built-in quality gates and continuous improvement mechanisms.

## Purpose
Addresses the complexity gap in agile story implementation by providing:

## Installation

```bash
# Install the story implementation expansion pack
bmad install expansion-pack story-implementation

# Verify installation
bmad list expansion-packs
```

## Usage Examples

### Simple Story Implementation
```bash
# For UI changes, content updates, simple fixes
*workflow story-simple epic_number=5 story_number=3

# Example output: Epic 5, Story 3 implemented with 9 validation steps
```

### Full Feature Implementation  
```bash
# For complex features, business logic, integrations
*workflow story-implementation epic_number=12 story_number=7

# Example output: Epic 12, Story 7 with comprehensive 15-step workflow
```

### Workflow Selection Validation
Both workflows include complexity validation warnings to ensure appropriate selection based on:
- Implementation scope and complexity
- Business logic requirements  
- Integration touchpoints
- Quality validation needs

## Workflow Selection Guide

| Criteria | story-simple | story-implementation |
|----------|--------------|---------------------|
| **Duration** | 2-3 days | 4-5 days |
| **Steps** | 9 optimized steps | 15 comprehensive steps |
| **Code Changes** | Single component focus | Multi-component integration |
| **Business Logic** | Minimal/none | Significant business rules |
| **Database Changes** | Read-only or minor | Schema changes, migrations |
| **Testing Scope** | Component-level | Integration and system-level |
| **Review Rounds** | Single efficient round | Multi-round comprehensive |

## Team Integration

### Agent Team Configuration
Add to your team configuration files:
```yaml
expansion_packs:
  - story-implementation

workflows:
  story_simple:
    trigger: "story-simple"
    agents: [sm, po, dev, architect]
  
  story_implementation:
    trigger: "story-implementation" 
    agents: [sm, po, dev, architect, qa, ux-expert, infra-devops-platform]
```
