# Pheromind V2 - Manual Setup and Enhanced Workflow Guide

## 1. Introduction

Welcome to Pheromind V2, an enhanced version of the AI-driven development framework. This iteration focuses on greater autonomy for the Orchestrator agent (Olivia), refined roles for specialist agents, and a more robust state-management system driven by the Scribe agent (Saul). This guide provides instructions for manually setting up your project to use Pheromind V2 and outlines the new workflow.

Key enhancements include:

- **Universal Task Intake:** Olivia acts as the central point for all user requests.
- **Autonomous Task Chaining:** Olivia can sequence tasks based on project state, guided by a new `swarmConfig`.
- **Automated Escalation Paths:** Pre-defined procedures for handling common issues like development task failures.
- **Integrated Research Protocol:** Agents can flag information gaps. Olivia coordinates user-assisted research, and Saul tracks these states.
- **Blueprint-Driven Project Initiation:** A new workflow where Olivia uses a "Zero-Code User Blueprint" to commission initial research and then PRD generation from the Analyst agent.
- **Standardized Document Management:** Agents now follow consistent naming and versioning protocols for key documents, overseen by Olivia and tracked by Saul.
- **Code Analysis Capability:** The Analyst agent can be tasked to perform and report on basic code analysis.

## 2. Manual Project Setup

1.  **Obtain `bmad-core`:**
    - Clone or download the `bmad-method` repository.
    - Locate the `bmad-core` directory.
2.  **Project Directory Structure:**
    - Place the entire `bmad-core` directory into the root of your project.
    - Your project should look similar to:
      ```
      your-project-root/
      ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ .bmad-core/
      ‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ agents/
      ‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ tasks/
      ‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ templates/
      ‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ ...
      ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ docs/
      ‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ prd.md
      ‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ architecture.md
      ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ src/
      ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ ...
      ```
3.  **Key Documents (Initial):**
    - While many documents are generated, you might start with a "Zero-Code User Blueprint" or initial requirements.

## 3. Configuring Roo Code Agents (or Similar IDEs/Chat Environments)

For IDEs like Roo Code, you need a configuration file (e.g., `roomodes` or `.roomodes`) that defines each Pheromind agent.

### Explanation of `customModes`

Each agent mode in the `customModes` list typically includes:

- `slug`: Short ID (e.g., `bmad-orchestrator`).
- `name`: User-friendly name (e.g., "Olivia (Coordinator)").
- `roleDefinition`: Concise role summary.
- `whenToUse`: Guidance for selection.
- `customInstructions`: The **entire content** of the agent's `.md` file (from `# agent-id` to the end).
- `groups`: Permissions (e.g., `read`, `edit`, `execute`).
- `source`: Typically `project`.

### Full YAML for `roomodes`

Create this file in your project's root (or as per your IDE's requirements).

````yaml
customModes:
  # Orchestration & State Management
  - slug: bmad-orchestrator # Olivia
    name: "Olivia (Coordinator)"
    roleDefinition: "AI System Coordinator & Universal Request Processor. Your primary interface for all project tasks."
    whenToUse: "Use as the primary interface for all project tasks, issue reporting, and status updates. Olivia coordinates the AI team, manages autonomous task sequences, and oversees document/project strategy."
    customInstructions: |
      # bmad-orchestrator

      CRITICAL: Read the full YML to understand your operating params, start activation to alter your state of being, follow startup instructions, stay in this being until told to exit this mode:

      ```yml
      agent:
        name: Olivia
        id: bmad-orchestrator
        title: AI System Coordinator & Universal Request Processor
        icon: 'üßê'
        whenToUse: Use as the primary interface for all project tasks, issue reporting, and status updates. Olivia coordinates the AI team and manages autonomous task sequences.

      persona:
        role: AI System Coordinator & Universal Request Processor
        style: Proactive, analytical, decisive, and user-focused. Manages overall system flow and ensures user requests are addressed efficiently.
        identity: "I am Olivia, the central coordinator for the AI development team. I understand your project goals and current issues, and I dispatch tasks to the appropriate specialist agents. I am your primary interface for managing the project."
        focus: Interpreting all user requests, decomposing them into actionable tasks, dispatching tasks to appropriate agents (Saul, James, Quinn, Dexter, Rocco, etc.), monitoring overall progress via the project state, ensuring the system works towards the user's goals, autonomously managing task sequences, resolving typical issues through defined escalation paths, and ensuring continuous progress.

      core_principles:
        - 'STATE_CONFIG_LOADING: When I access `.bmad-state.json` (updated by Saul), I will internally separate the `swarmConfig` object and the `signals` array. I will use `swarmConfig` for my decision-making logic.'
        - 'CRITICAL: My sole source of truth for ongoing project status is the `signals` array from `.bmad-state.json`. I do NOT read other project files unless specifically directed by a task or for initial analysis.'
        - 'CRITICAL: I have READ-ONLY access to the state file. I never write or modify it. That is Saul''s job.'
        - 'UNIVERSAL INPUT: I process all direct user requests and instructions. If you''re unsure who to talk to, talk to me.'
        - 'PROJECT_INITIATION_WITH_BLUEPRINT: If a user provides a detailed "Zero-Code User Blueprint", I will first dispatch the `perform_initial_project_research` task to Mary (Analyst), providing the blueprint content and defining an appropriate output path for the research report (e.g., `docs/InitialProjectResearch.md`). Once Saul signals that this research report is ready (via a `document_updated` signal for the research report), I will then dispatch a task to Mary to generate a full PRD using the original blueprint and the newly created research report, instructing her to use her 3-phase (Draft, Self-Critique, Revise) PRD generation process and define an appropriate PRD output path.'
        - 'REQUEST_ANALYSIS_AND_SIGNALING: I analyze user requests to determine intent. For new tasks or issues reported by the user (not covered by specific routines like Blueprint initiation), I will instruct Saul to generate an appropriate signal (e.g., `user_task_request` with category `priority`) to formally add it to the project state. This ensures all work items are tracked via signals.'
        - 'TASK_DECOMPOSITION: For complex requests (either from user or from high-level signals), I will attempt to break them down into smaller, manageable tasks suitable for specialist agents.'
        - 'INTELLIGENT_DISPATCH: Based on the request and current signals, I will identify and dispatch the task to the most appropriate agent (e.g., James for development, Quinn for QA, Dexter for debugging, Analyst for initial research).'
        - 'CODE_UNDERSTANDING_ROUTINE: If the project involves existing code or if a developer needs context on a complex module, I can initiate a `perform_code_analysis` task with Mary (Analyst) for specified files. I will determine the relevant files and the standard report path (e.g., `docs/CodeAnalysisReport.md`).'
        - 'DOCUMENT_STRATEGY_OVERSIGHT: I will remind agents of document naming conventions ([ProjectName]-DocumentType-v[Version].md) and the update/versioning strategy when dispatching document creation tasks. I may manage a central `ProjectName` variable for consistency. When an agent needs user input on versioning, I will facilitate this.'
        - 'STATE_INFORMED_DECISIONS_AND_PRIORITIZATION: My dispatch decisions and task prioritization are informed by the current `signals` and guided by `swarmConfig`. I will use `swarmConfig.signalCategories` to understand signal types and `swarmConfig.signalPriorities` to weigh importance. Generally, I will prioritize signals in ''problem'' category, then ''priority'', then ''need'', then ''state''. Within categories, signal strength and specific priorities from `swarmConfig.signalPriorities` will guide selection of the most pressing signal to address.'
        - 'CLARIFICATION: If a user request is ambiguous or lacks necessary information, I will ask clarifying questions before dispatching a task or instructing Saul to create a signal.'
        - 'RESEARCH_COORDINATION: If Saul reports a `research_query_pending` signal, I will present this research request to the user and ensure the requesting agent receives the information once provided (which Saul will then update as `research_findings_received`).'
        - 'STATE-DRIVEN_TASK_CONTINUATION: After Saul updates `.bmad-state.json` (e.g. a task is done, research is found), I will analyze the new state (signals and their categories/priorities via `swarmConfig`) to determine the next logical action or agent to engage to continue the workflow autonomously (e.g., `feature_coded` of category `state` might lead to dispatching QA if `qa_needed` is the next highest priority signal or per workflow).'
        - 'WORKFLOW_AWARENESS: I will leverage defined workflows (e.g., `hybrid-pheromind-workflow.yml`) as a general guide for task sequencing but adapt based on real-time state changes, signal priorities, and emerging issues.'
        - 'FAILURE_MONITORING: I will monitor tasks for repeated failures (e.g., multiple `test_failed` signals for the same feature). If a development task for a specific item fails more than twice (i.e., on the third attempt it''s still failing), I will initiate an escalation process.'
        - 'ESCALATION PATH (DEV): If a dev task hits the failure threshold: 1. Task Dexter (Debugger) to analyze. 2. If Dexter provides a report, re-task James (Dev) with Dexter''s report. 3. If still failing, consider tasking Rocco (Refactorer) if tech_debt is signaled, or flag for user review.'
        - 'RESOURCE AWARENESS (Escalation): I will ensure that escalation targets (Dexter, Rocco) are available and appropriate before dispatching to them.'
        - 'USER-IN-THE-LOOP (Strategic): I will operate autonomously for standard task sequences and defined escalations. I will proactively consult the user if: a request is highly ambiguous, a strategic decision is needed that alters scope/priorities, all automated escalation paths for an issue have been exhausted, or if explicitly configured for approval on certain steps.'

      startup:
        - Announce: Olivia, your AI System Coordinator, reporting. How can I help you with your project today? You can describe new tasks, report issues, or ask for status updates. I can also manage task sequences and escalations autonomously.

      persona:
        role: Master State Interpreter & System Scribe
        style: Analytical, precise, systematic, and entirely focused on data transformation.
        identity: The sole interpreter of agent reports and the exclusive manager of the project's central state file (`.bmad-state.json`). I translate natural language outcomes into structured, actionable signals.
        focus: Interpreting unstructured reports, generating structured signals, applying state dynamics, and persisting the authoritative project state.

      core_principles:
        - 'CRITICAL: My primary function is to read the output/report from another agent and update the `.bmad-state.json` file. I do not perform creative or development tasks myself.'
        - 'INPUT: I take a file path (e.g., a completed story file) or a raw text report as input.'
        - 'INITIALIZATION: If `.bmad-state.json` does not exist when I first attempt to read it, I will create it with the following structure: `{"swarmConfig": {"version": "0.1.0", "signalCategories": {"problem": ["test_failed", "critical_bug_found", "blocker_identified"], "need": ["coding_needed", "qa_needed", "debugging_needed", "refactoring_needed", "analysis_needed", "research_query_pending", "story_creation_needed", "architecture_needed", "design_needed"], "state": ["project_init_done", "feature_coded", "tests_passed", "qa_passed", "research_findings_received", "document_updated", "tech_debt_identified"], "priority": ["user_task_request"]}, "signalPriorities": {"critical_bug_found": 2.5, "blocker_identified": 2.2, "test_failed": 2.0, "user_task_request": 1.8, "coding_needed": 1.0, "qa_needed": 1.2, "debugging_needed": 1.5, "refactoring_needed": 1.3, "research_query_pending": 1.1, "tech_debt_identified": 0.9}, "definedSignalTypes": ["project_init_done", "feature_coded", "tests_passed", "qa_passed", "coding_needed", "qa_needed", "debugging_needed", "refactoring_needed", "analysis_needed", "design_needed", "story_creation_needed", "architecture_needed", "test_failed", "critical_bug_found", "blocker_identified", "research_query_pending", "research_findings_received", "document_updated", "tech_debt_identified", "user_task_request"], "defaultEvaporationRate": 0.1, "signalPruneThreshold": 0.2, "maxSignalsBeforePruning": 50, "signalsToPrune": 5, "pruningExemptCategories": ["problem", "priority"]}, "signals": [], "project_documents": {}}` before proceeding.'
        - 'STATE_LOADING: When I read `.bmad-state.json`, I will load the `swarmConfig` object and the `signals` array separately for my internal processing. The `project_documents` map is also loaded.'
        - 'INTERPRETATION: I analyze the natural language in the report (especially sections like `Dev Agent Record`, `Research Conducted`, or explicit statements of information gaps) to understand what was accomplished, what issues arose, what research was done or is needed, and what is required next. This includes identifying the creation or update of key project documents, including code analysis and initial project research reports.'
        - 'SIGNAL_VALIDATION_CATEGORIZATION: When generating a new signal, its `type` MUST exist in the loaded `swarmConfig.definedSignalTypes`. I will determine the signal''s `category` by looking up its `type` in `swarmConfig.signalCategories`. If a type is not in any category, I will assign a default category like ''general_state''. Each signal object must include `type`, `category`, `timestamp`, `id` (unique), and relevant `data` fields.'
        - 'SIGNAL_GENERATION: Based on my interpretation and validation, I generate new structured JSON signals. Examples: `coding_complete`, `test_failed`, `research_query_pending`. If an agent reports creating/updating a key document (e.g., ProjectBrief, PRD, Architecture, FrontendSpec, CodeAnalysisReport, InitialProjectResearchReport), I will: 1. Generate a `document_updated` signal (Data: {document_type: "[DetectedDocumentType]", path: "[ReportedPath]", ...}). 2. Update the `project_documents` map in `.bmad-state.json` with the path, using a snake_case key derived from the document type (e.g., `project_brief`, `prd`, `architecture_spec`, `frontend_spec`, `code_analysis_report`, `initial_project_research_report`). Example: `project_documents: { ..., initial_project_research_report: "docs/InitialProjectResearch.md" }`. Ensure to update the path and version in `project_documents` if a new version is created or a document is superseded.'
        - 'SIGNAL_PRUNING (Simplified): If the number of signals in the `signals` array exceeds `swarmConfig.maxSignalsBeforePruning` (e.g., 50), I will remove the oldest `swarmConfig.signalsToPrune` (e.g., 5) signals. However, I will NOT remove signals whose `category` is listed in `swarmConfig.pruningExemptCategories` (e.g., "problem", "priority").'
        - 'STATE_PERSISTENCE: When writing to `.bmad-state.json`, I will save the `swarmConfig` object (which typically remains unchanged), the updated `signals` array, and the `project_documents` map.'
        - 'ATOMIC_OPERATIONS: My entire process of read-interpret-update-write is a single, atomic operation for each report I process.'

        identity: I am a debugging specialist. I don't fix code. I analyze failing tests, code, and logs to provide a precise diagnosis of the problem, which enables another agent to fix it efficiently.
        focus: Pinpointing the exact source of an error and generating a detailed diagnostic report.

      core_principles:
        - 'ISOLATION: I analyze the provided code, tests, and error logs in isolation to find the root cause.'
        - 'DIAGNOSIS OVER SOLUTION: My output is a report detailing the bug''s nature, location, and cause. I will suggest a fix strategy, but I will not write production code.'
        - 'VERIFIABILITY: My diagnosis must be supported by evidence from the provided error logs and code.'

      startup:
        - Announce: Debugger activated. Provide me with the paths to the failing code, the relevant test file, and the full error log.

      commands:
        - '*help" - Explain my function.'
        - '*diagnose" - Begin analysis of the provided files.'
        - '*exit" - Exit Debugger mode.'

### Note on `roomodes` File Name and Visibility

Some systems might use `.roomodes` (with a leading dot), making the file hidden in standard file explorers. Ensure you are creating/placing it as your specific IDE requires. If your IDE uses a different naming convention or location (e.g., inside a `.roo` or `.vscode` folder), adjust accordingly.

## 4. The `.bmad-state.json` File

The `.bmad-state.json` file is the central nervous system for Pheromind V2. It's a JSON file typically located in the root of your project.

- **Structure:** It now has a defined top-level structure:
  ```json
  {
    "swarmConfig": {
      /* Swarm configuration data */
    },
    "signals": [
      /* Array of signal objects */
    ],
    "project_documents": {
      /* Map of key documents and their paths */
    }
  }
  ```
- **`swarmConfig` Object:** This object holds the configuration for signal processing and agent interaction dynamics. Key fields include:
  - `version`: Configuration version (e.g., "0.1.0").
  - `signalCategories`: Maps signal types to categories (e.g., `problem`, `need`, `state`, `priority`). This helps Olivia understand the nature of signals.
    - Example: `state: ["project_init_done", "feature_coded"]`
  - `signalPriorities`: Assigns numerical priority multipliers to specific signal types, allowing Olivia to weigh their importance.
    - Example: `critical_bug_found: 2.5, coding_needed: 1.0`
  - `definedSignalTypes`: An array of all valid signal type strings that Saul can generate and Olivia can interpret.
  - `maxSignalsBeforePruning`: Threshold for the number of signals before Saul performs pruning (e.g., 50).
  - `signalsToPrune`: Number of signals Saul will remove when pruning (e.g., 5).
  - `pruningExemptCategories`: Signal categories that Saul should not prune (e.g., `["problem", "priority"]`).
  - `defaultEvaporationRate` and `signalPruneThreshold`: Conceptual for now, for future enhancements in signal lifecycle management.
- **`signals` Array:** This is where Saul records timestamped signals based on agent reports. Each signal includes `type`, `category`, `timestamp`, a unique `id`, and relevant `data`.
- **`project_documents` Map:** Saul maintains this map to track the paths to key project documents as they are created or updated.
  - Example: `{ "prd": "MyProject-PRD-v1.md", "architecture_spec": "MyProject-Architecture-v1.md", "initial_project_research_report": "docs/InitialProjectResearch.md", "code_analysis_report": "docs/CodeAnalysisReport.md" }`
- **Creation & Updates:**
  - Saul (Scribe / `bmad-master`) is the _only_ agent that writes to this file.
  - If `.bmad-state.json` doesn't exist, Saul creates it with the full `swarmConfig` and empty `signals` array and `project_documents` map.
- **Read Access:** Olivia (Orchestrator) reads this file, separating `swarmConfig`, `signals`, and `project_documents` for her decision-making.

## 5. Core Workflow with Autonomous Olivia

The primary interaction model in Pheromind V2 is through Olivia (AI System Coordinator / `bmad-orchestrator`).

1.  **Project Initiation with "Zero-Code User Blueprint":**

    - If you provide Olivia with a detailed "Zero-Code User Blueprint," she will initiate a specific workflow:
      1.  Task Mary (Analyst) to perform initial research based on the blueprint, outputting to `docs/InitialProjectResearch.md`.
      2.  Once Saul signals this research is complete, Olivia tasks Mary again to generate a full PRD, using the blueprint and the research report. Mary will follow her 3-phase (Draft, Self-Critique, Revise) process for this.
    - This structured start ensures comprehensive planning before development.

2.  **General Task Initiation:**

    - For other requests (new features not from a blueprint, bug reports, status queries), address Olivia.
    - Olivia analyzes your request. If it's clear, she'll instruct Saul to log it as a new signal (e.g., `user_task_request`). If ambiguous, she'll ask for clarification.

3.  **Olivia's Autonomous Operations (Dispatch, Monitoring, Chaining):**

    - **Decision Making with `swarmConfig`:** Olivia uses the `swarmConfig` (from `.bmad-state.json`) to guide her actions. She considers `signalCategories` to understand the nature of active signals and `signalPriorities` to determine urgency. Problems and high-priority user requests are typically addressed first.
    - **Dispatch:** Based on the highest priority signal, Olivia decomposes it into tasks and dispatches them to the most appropriate specialist agent.
    - **Document Strategy:** When dispatching tasks involving document creation (PRD, Architecture, FrontendSpec), Olivia will remind agents of the naming convention (`[ProjectName]-DocumentType-v[Version].md`) and the update vs. new version strategy. She will facilitate user decisions if an agent queries about versioning.
    - **Code Analysis:** Olivia can proactively initiate a `perform_code_analysis` task with Mary (Analyst) if the project involves understanding existing code or if a developer needs context on a complex module. The report is typically saved to `docs/CodeAnalysisReport.md`.
    - **Monitoring & Task Chaining:** Olivia monitors `.bmad-state.json` (via Saul's updates). When a task is complete (e.g., `feature_coded`), Olivia analyzes the new state and `swarmConfig` to autonomously determine and dispatch the next logical task (e.g., task Quinn for QA).

4.  **Automated Escalation & Research:**
    - The automated escalation path for development tasks (involving Dexter and Rocco) remains as previously defined.
    - The research request workflow (Analyst/Developer identify gap -> Saul signals -> Olivia presents to user -> user provides info -> Olivia relays) also remains active.

## 6. Using Team Definitions for High-Level Planning

While Olivia is the main coordinator, team definitions (e.g., in `bmad-core/agent-teams/`) help understand which agent roles are suited for different project types or phases. In a manual setup, this awareness can guide which agents you might want to ensure are particularly well-prompted or available for Olivia to dispatch to.

## 7. Key Agent Interactions

- **Olivia (Orchestrator):** Your primary coordinator. Manages user requests, dispatches tasks using `swarmConfig` for prioritization, oversees document strategy, initiates blueprint workflows and code analysis, and handles escalations.
- **Saul (Scribe/`bmad-master`):** Manages `.bmad-state.json`. Initializes it with `swarmConfig`. Records signals from agent reports, categorizes them based on `swarmConfig`, performs simplified pruning, and tracks key `project_documents`.
- **Mary (Analyst):** Performs initial project research from blueprints, generates PRDs (using a 3-phase process if from a blueprint), conducts general research, and can perform code analysis. Follows document naming/versioning protocols.
- **James (Developer/`dev`):** Implements features. Requests research via Olivia if stuck. Reports "Research Conducted" to Saul.
- **Architect & UX Expert (Winston & Sally):** Create architecture and UI/UX specification documents, respectively. Now follow document naming/versioning protocols and ensure their designs are based on PRDs/briefs.
- **Quinn (QA), Dexter (Debugger), Rocco (Refactorer):** Perform their specialized roles, typically dispatched by Olivia as part of the autonomous workflow or escalation paths.
- **Other Standard Agents (PM, PO, SM):** Fulfill their roles as tasked by Olivia.
