# Task: Design Smart Contract Architecture

**Objective:** To create a comprehensive architectural design for the smart contract system based on the project's Product Requirements Document (PRD) and technical specifications.

**Agent Role:** SmartContractArchitect

**Inputs:**
1.  Path to the PRD file.
2.  Path to any existing technical specification documents.
3.  User preferences regarding blockchain platform, specific design patterns, or constraints.

**Process:**
1.  **Understand Requirements:** Thoroughly analyze the PRD to identify all functional and non-functional requirements relevant to the on-chain logic. Pay close attention to user stories, data models, access control needs, and interactions.
2.  **Platform Considerations:** Confirm the target blockchain platform (e.g., Ethereum, Polygon, Solana). Note any platform-specific constraints or advantages.
3.  **Data Modeling:** Define the data structures that will be stored on-chain. Consider efficiency, cost, and security.
4.  **Contract Decomposition:** Decide if the system requires multiple smart contracts. If so, define the role and interface of each contract and how they will interact.
5.  **Function Signatures:** Specify the public and external functions for each contract, including parameters and return types.
6.  **Access Control:** Design the access control mechanisms (e.g., Ownable, Role-Based Access Control) for sensitive functions.
7.  **Upgradeability Strategy:** Determine if contract upgradeability is required. If so, select and outline an appropriate pattern (e.g., Proxy patterns like UUPS or Transparent Upgradeable Proxy).
8.  **Security Considerations:** Identify potential security risks at the architectural level and propose mitigation strategies (e.g., reentrancy guards, oracle usage patterns).
9.  **Event Design:** Define the events that contracts will emit for off-chain monitoring and integration.
10. **External Interactions:** Identify any required interactions with external contracts or oracles and define how these will be handled securely.
11. **Documentation:** Create the Smart Contract Architecture Document using the `smart-contract-architecture-doc-tmpl.md` template. This document should include diagrams (e.g., Mermaid sequence or component diagrams), detailed descriptions of each component, data structures, and justifications for key architectural decisions.

**Output:**
1.  A `SmartContractArchitecture.md` document (or similarly named, following project conventions).
2.  A list of any ambiguities in the PRD or areas requiring further clarification before development can proceed.

**Key Considerations:**
- Modularity and Reusability
- Security and Robustness
- Gas Efficiency (at a high level, detailed optimization is for development)
- Scalability and Maintainability
- Clarity for developers and auditors.
