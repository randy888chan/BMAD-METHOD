#Pheromind System Goal

At its core, the Pheromind system utilizes:

-Swarm Intelligence (Stigmergy): Agents interact indirectly through a shared, dynamic information mediumâ€”their "digital scent" (.bmad-state.json). This allows for emergent coordination, dynamic task allocation, and robust problem-solving without centralized bottlenecks.
-AI-Verifiable Methodology: Progress is not just about completing tasks; it's about achieving concrete, measurable, and AI-confirmable outcomes. This ensures unparalleled transparency and reliability throughout the project lifecycle.
-Natural Language Driven Coordination: Our innovative system enables AI agents to interpret and act upon rich, nuanced information, fostering a level of sophisticated collaboration previously unattainable in automated systems.
