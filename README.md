# Pheromind: The Autonomous AI Development Swarm

Pheromind is a revolutionary framework for orchestrating a swarm of specialized AI agents to autonomously build software. It moves beyond simple scripting to a model of **true autonomous orchestration**, where a central intelligence plans, executes, and learns with minimal human intervention.

At its core, the system utilizes:

- **Stigmergic Coordination:** Agents interact indirectly by leaving "digital pheromones" in a shared state file (`.ai/state.json`), enabling complex, coordinated behavior without direct communication.
- **Unified Autonomous Cycle:** A single, intelligent orchestrator manages the entire project lifecycleâ€”from planning and architecture to coding, verification, and self-improvementâ€”within your IDE.
- **AI-Verifiable Outcomes:** Progress is measured by concrete, programmatically-confirmable outputs, bringing mathematical rigor and transparency to project tracking.
- **Constitutional AI:** All agents operate under a shared set of core principles (`bmad-core/system_docs/03_Core_Principles.md`), ensuring consistent, predictable, and safe behavior.

## ðŸš€ Installation & Upgrade

### One-Time Authentication Setup
Because Pheromind is distributed via the GitHub Package Registry, you must first authenticate your local machine. You only need to do this once.

1.  Create a [GitHub Personal Access Token (Classic)](https://github.com/settings/tokens/new) with the `read:packages` scope.
2.  Log in to the GitHub NPM registry by running the following command and pasting your token when prompted for a password:
    ```bash
    npm login --scope=@randy888chan --registry=https://npm.pkg.github.com
    ```
    (Use your GitHub username for the username prompt).

### For New Projects
Install the Pheromind framework into your project directory.
```bash
# Run this command in the root of your new project folder
npx @randy888chan/pheromind install

For Existing V3 Projects
An interactive upgrader is available to transition your project to the new architecture.
Generated bash
# From your existing project's root directory
npx @randy888chan/pheromind upgrade
Use code with caution.
Bash

### **New File:** `CONTRIBUTING.md`

**Analysis:**
There is no formal documentation separating the workflow for *developing* Pheromind from *using* it. This leads to confusion, such as relying on `npm link` in a user context.

**Reasoning for Change (Jack Ma):**
To build a platform, you must have clear rules of engagement for contributors. This document establishes those rules. It formalizes the local development workflow (using `npm link` correctly) and clarifies the path to contribution. This encourages community involvement and ensures the project itself can scale.

**Updated File Content:**
```markdown
# Contributing to Pheromind

Thank you for your interest in contributing to the Pheromind project!

## Development Workflow

This project uses `npm link` to enable local development and testing against other projects on your machine.

### Setting up the Local Link

1.  **Clone the Repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/randy888chan/Stigmergy.git
    cd Stigmergy
    ```

2.  **Install Dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3.  **Create the Global Symlink:**
    From the root of the `Stigmergy` directory, run:
    ```bash
    npm link
    ```
    This creates a global symlink from `@randy888chan/pheromind` to your local source code.

### Using the Local Version in Another Project

1.  **Navigate to Your Test Project:**
    ```bash
    cd /path/to/your/test-project
    ```

2.  **Link the Package:**
    Run the following command to make your test project use your local version of Pheromind instead of the published one:
    ```bash
    npm link @randy888chan/pheromind
    ```

3.  **Run Pheromind:**
    You can now use the `pheromind` command within your test project, and any changes you make in the Pheromind source code will be reflected immediately.
    ```bash
    npx pheromind install
    ```

## Publishing a New Version

This project uses `semantic-release` to automate versioning and publishing based on Conventional Commits. New versions are published automatically via the GitHub Actions workflow defined in `.github/workflows/release.yml` when commits are pushed to the `main` branch.
## The Pheromind Cycle: Two Paths to Autonomy

Pheromind offers a flexible workflow. You can start planning directly in your IDE or leverage a Web UI for initial research and then seamlessly ingest the results.

### Path 1: IDE-First Workflow (Recommended)

This is the most direct path to autonomous development.

1.  **Initiation:** In your IDE, activate the Chief Orchestrator, **`@bmad-master` (Saul)**.
2.  **Directive:** Give Saul a high-level project goal.
    > "We need to build a new application. A project brief is located at `docs/brief.md`. Please begin the project."
3.  **Autonomous Orchestration:** Saul will now initiate the Pheromind Cycle, managing planning, execution, verification, and adaptation autonomously until the project is complete.

### Path 2: Web-to-IDE Ingestion Workflow (Optional)

This path is ideal for cost-effective initial planning using the web research capabilities of models like Gemini.

1.  **Phase 1: Web UI Planning.** Use a tool like Gemini with the `team-planning-crew.txt` bundle to perform research and generate your initial `prd.md` and `architecture.md`. Save these files to your local `docs/` folder.
2.  **Phase 2: IDE Ingestion.** In your IDE, activate the Chief Orchestrator, **`@bmad-master` (Saul)**.
3.  **Directive:** Instruct Saul to ingest the externally created documents.
    > `*ingest_docs`
4.  **Autonomous Integration:** Saul will automatically process, shard, and integrate these documents into the swarm's memory. Once complete, he will signal that the project is `READY_FOR_EXECUTION`, and the autonomous Pheromind Cycle will begin.

Of course. The board has convened, reviewed the repository and the state of the Pheromind initiative, and produced the following strategic audit and architectural evolution plan.

## Agent Archetypes

The swarm is composed of specialized agents, each with a clear role.

| Agent ID              | Name (Archetype)                     | Core Responsibilities                                          |
| --------------------- | ------------------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **`@bmad-master`**      | **Saul (Chief Orchestrator)**        | The master brain. Manages the entire lifecycle. Interprets all reports and dispatches all tasks. |
| `@pm`, `@architect`   | (Planners)                           | Create the project blueprint (`docs/`) under Saul's direction. |
| `@sm`                 | Bob (Task Decomposer)                | Breaks down epics from the blueprint into actionable stories. |
| **`@bmad-orchestrator`** | **Olivia (Execution Coordinator)**   | A sub-orchestrator, dispatched by Saul to manage the `dev->qa->po` loop for a single story. |
| `@dev`, `@victor`     | (Executors)                          | Write code and implement stories.                              |
| `@qa`, `@po`          | (Verifiers)                          | Ensure quality, standards compliance, and alignment with the blueprint. |
| `@debugger`           | Dexter (Adaptive Responder)          | Diagnoses complex failures and proposes new paths forward.     |
| `@meta`               | Metis (System Auditor)               | Analyzes swarm performance to make the system itself better.   |
