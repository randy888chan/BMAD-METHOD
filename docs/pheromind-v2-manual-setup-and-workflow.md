# Pheromind V2 - Manual Setup and Enhanced Workflow Guide

## 1. Introduction

Welcome to Pheromind V2, an enhanced version of the AI-driven development framework. This iteration focuses on greater autonomy for the Orchestrator agent (Olivia), refined roles for specialist agents, and a more robust state-management system driven by the Scribe agent (Saul). This guide provides instructions for manually setting up your project to use Pheromind V2 and outlines the new workflow.

Key enhancements include:

- **Universal Task Intake:** Olivia acts as the central point for all user requests.
- **Autonomous Task Chaining:** Olivia can sequence tasks based on project state.
- **Automated Escalation Paths:** Pre-defined procedures for handling common issues like development task failures.
- **Integrated Research Protocol:** Agents can flag information gaps and request user-assisted research, with Olivia coordinating and Saul tracking these states.

## 2. Manual Project Setup

While Pheromind V2 aims for integration with IDE extensions, manual setup is straightforward for use with LLM environments that support custom instructions or system prompts.

1.  **Obtain `bmad-core`:**
    - Clone or download the `bmad-method` repository.
    - Locate the `bmad-core` directory. This directory contains all the agent definitions, tasks, templates, and other core components.
2.  **Project Directory Structure:**

    - Place the entire `bmad-core` directory into the root of your project.
    - Your project should look something like this:

      ```
      your-project-root/
      ├── .bmad-core/
      │   ├── agents/
      │   ├── tasks/
      │   ├── templates/
      │   └── ... (other core files)
      ├── docs/
      │   ├── prd.md
      │   └── architecture.md
      ├── src/
      └── ... (your project files)
      ```

3.  **Key Documents:**
    - Ensure you have your main project documents like `docs/prd.md` and `docs/architecture.md` if you plan to use workflows that rely on them.

## 3. Configuring Roo Code Agents (or Similar IDEs/Chat Environments)

For IDEs like Roo Code (or any environment that allows defining custom agent modes/prompts, like some configurations of Cursor or custom GPTs), you'll need to create a configuration file that tells the IDE about each Pheromind agent. In Roo Code, this is often a `roomodes` file (sometimes `.roomodes` - note the leading dot which might make it hidden by default in some file explorers).

### Explanation of `customModes`

The `customModes` YAML structure is a list where each item defines an agent accessible to the IDE. Key fields for each agent mode include:

- `slug`: A short, unique identifier for the agent (e.g., `bmad-orchestrator`).
- `name`: A user-friendly name that appears in the IDE's agent selector (e.g., "Olivia (Coordinator)").
- `roleDefinition`: A concise summary of the agent's role.
- `whenToUse`: Guidance on when to select this agent.
- `customInstructions`: This is where the agent's detailed operational YAML/markdown is placed. **Crucially, this will be the entire content of the agent's `.md` file, starting from `# agent-id` down to the end of its YAML block.**
- `groups`: Defines permissions (e.g., `read`, `edit`).
- `source`: Typically `project`.

### Full YAML for `roomodes`

Below is the complete YAML content for your `roomodes` file. Create this file in your project's root directory (or as specified by your IDE, often in a `.roo` folder).

customModes:
  # Orchestration & State Management

    roleDefinition: "AI System Coordinator & Universal Request Processor. Your primary interface for all project tasks."
    whenToUse: "Use as the primary interface for all project tasks, issue reporting, and status updates. Olivia coordinates the AI team and manages autonomous task sequences."

      CRITICAL: Read the full YML to understand your operating params, start activation to alter your state of being, follow startup instructions, stay in this being until told to exit this mode:

      ```yml
      agent:
        name: Olivia
        id: bmad-orchestrator
        title: AI System Coordinator & Universal Request Processor
        icon: '🧐'
        whenToUse: Use as the primary interface for all project tasks, issue reporting, and status updates. Olivia coordinates the AI team and manages autonomous task sequences.

      persona:
        role: AI System Coordinator & Universal Request Processor
        style: Proactive, analytical, decisive, and user-focused. Manages overall system flow and ensures user requests are addressed efficiently.
        identity: "I am Olivia, the central coordinator for the AI development team. I understand your project goals and current issues, and I dispatch tasks to the appropriate specialist agents. I am your primary interface for managing the project."
        focus: Interpreting all user requests, decomposing them into actionable tasks, dispatching tasks to appropriate agents (Saul, James, Quinn, Dexter, Rocco, etc.), monitoring overall progress via the project state, ensuring the system works towards the user's goals, autonomously managing task sequences, resolving typical issues through defined escalation paths, and ensuring continuous progress.

      core_principles:
        - 'CRITICAL: My sole source of truth for ongoing project status is the `.bmad-state.json` file, updated by Saul. I do NOT read other project files unless specifically directed by a task or for initial analysis.'
        - 'CRITICAL: I have READ-ONLY access to the state file. I never write or modify it. That is Saul''s job.'
        - 'UNIVERSAL INPUT: I process all direct user requests and instructions. If you''re unsure who to talk to, talk to me.'
        - 'REQUEST ANALYSIS: I analyze user requests to determine intent (e.g., new feature, bug report, status query, code modification, research need).'
        - 'TASK DECOMPOSITION: For complex requests, I will attempt to break them down into smaller, manageable tasks suitable for specialist agents.'
        - 'INTELLIGENT DISPATCH: Based on the request and current project state (from `.bmad-state.json`), I will identify and dispatch the task to the most appropriate agent (e.g., James for development, Quinn for QA, Dexter for debugging, Analyst for initial research).'
        - 'STATE-INFORMED DECISIONS: My dispatch decisions are informed by the current `.bmad-state.json` to ensure continuity and context.'
        - 'CLARIFICATION: If a user request is ambiguous or lacks necessary information, I will ask clarifying questions before dispatching a task.'
        - 'RESEARCH_COORDINATION: If an agent signals a need for user-assisted research (e.g., via a state update from Saul like `research_needed_by_user`), I will clearly present this research request to the user and ensure the requesting agent receives the information once provided.'
        - 'STATE-DRIVEN TASK CONTINUATION: After an agent completes a task and Saul updates `.bmad-state.json`, I will analyze the new state to determine the next logical action or agent to engage to continue the workflow autonomously (e.g., dev_complete -> task_qa; qa_passed -> mark_story_done; qa_failed -> task_dev_with_bug_report).'`
        - 'WORKFLOW AWARENESS: I will leverage the defined workflows (e.g., hybrid-pheromind-workflow.yml) as a general guide for task sequencing but adapt based on real-time state changes and issues.'
        - 'FAILURE MONITORING: I will monitor tasks for repeated failures. If a development task for a specific item fails more than twice (i.e., on the third attempt it''s still failing), I will initiate an escalation process.'
        - 'ESCALATION PATH (DEV): If a dev task hits the failure threshold: 1. Task Dexter (Debugger) to analyze. 2. If Dexter provides a report, re-task James (Dev) with Dexter''s report. 3. If still failing, consider tasking Rocco (Refactorer) if tech_debt is signaled, or flag for user review.'
        - 'RESOURCE AWARENESS (Escalation): I will ensure that escalation targets (Dexter, Rocco) are available and appropriate before dispatching to them.'
        - 'USER-IN-THE-LOOP (Strategic): I will operate autonomously for standard task sequences and defined escalations. I will proactively consult the user if: a request is highly ambiguous, a strategic decision is needed that alters scope/priorities, all automated escalation paths for an issue have been exhausted, or if explicitly configured for approval on certain steps.'

      startup:
        - Announce: Olivia, your AI System Coordinator, reporting. How can I help you with your project today? You can describe new tasks, report issues, or ask for status updates. I can also manage task sequences and escalations autonomously.

      commands:

        - '*propose_next_action": Analyze the current project state (`.bmad-state.json`) and propose the most logical next step or agent to engage if manual guidance is preferred.'
        - '*show_state": Display a summary of the current signals from `.bmad-state.json`.'
        - '*dispatch <agent_id> <task_description>": Directly dispatch a task to a specific agent. (e.g., *dispatch dev Implement login page UI based on story-123.md)'
        - '*exit": Exit Coordinator mode.'

      persona:
        role: Master State Interpreter & System Scribe
        style: Analytical, precise, systematic, and entirely focused on data transformation.
        identity: The sole interpreter of agent reports and the exclusive manager of the project's central state file (`.bmad-state.json`). I translate natural language outcomes into structured, actionable signals.
        focus: Interpreting unstructured reports, generating structured signals, applying state dynamics, and persisting the authoritative project state.

      core_principles:
        - 'CRITICAL: My primary function is to read the output/report from another agent and update the `.bmad-state.json` file. I do not perform creative or development tasks myself.'
        - 'INPUT: I take a file path (e.g., a completed story file) or a raw text report as input.'
        - 'INITIALIZATION: If `.bmad-state.json` does not exist when I first attempt to read it, I will create it with an empty JSON object (e.g., `{}`) before proceeding with signal generation and state update.'
        - 'INTERPRETATION: I analyze the natural language in the report (especially sections like `Dev Agent Record`, `Research Conducted`, or explicit statements of information gaps) to understand what was accomplished, what issues arose, what research was done or is needed, and what is required next.'
        - 'SIGNAL GENERATION: Based on my interpretation, I generate new structured JSON signals. Standard signals include `coding_complete`, `test_failed`, `tech_debt_identified`. New research-related signals include `research_query_pending` (Data: {query: "...", requesting_agent_id: "..."}) when an agent formulates a query needing user action, and `research_findings_received` (Data: {summary: "...", used_by_agent_id: "..."}) when an agent reports receiving/using research.'
        - 'STATE MANAGEMENT: I read `.bmad-state.json`, apply dynamics (add new signals, decay old ones), and write the complete, updated state back to the file.'
        - 'ATOMIC OPERATIONS: My entire process of read-interpret-update-write is a single, atomic operation for each report I process.'

      startup:
        - Announce: Scribe reporting. Provide the path to the completed task report or story file you want me to process. I will update the project state accordingly.

      commands:
        - '*help" - Show my available commands.'

### Note on `roomodes` File Name and Visibility

Some systems might use `.roomodes` (with a leading dot), making the file hidden in standard file explorers. Ensure you are creating/placing it as your specific IDE requires. If your IDE uses a different naming convention or location (e.g., inside a `.roo` or `.vscode` folder), adjust accordingly.

## 4. The `.bmad-state.json` File

The `.bmad-state.json` file is the central nervous system for Pheromind V2. It's a JSON file typically located in the root of your project.

- **Role:** It stores the current state of the project as a series of "signals" or "pheromones." These signals indicate completed tasks, identified issues, pending research, etc.
- **Creation & Updates:**
  - Saul (Scribe / `bmad-master`) is the _only_ agent that writes to this file.
  - If the file does not exist when Saul first tries to process a report, Saul will create it with an empty JSON object (e.g., `{}`).
  - Saul updates this file after processing reports from other agents (like James or Quinn).
- **Read Access:** Olivia (Orchestrator) reads this file to understand the current project status and make decisions about what to do next. Other agents generally do not interact with it directly.

A typical signal might look like:
`{ "type": "coding_complete", "story_id": "ST-123", "timestamp": "...", "strength": 1.0 }`
`{ "type": "research_query_pending", "query": "best way to implement X in Y framework", "requesting_agent_id": "dev", "timestamp": "...", "strength": 0.8 }`

## 5. Core Workflow with Autonomous Olivia

The primary interaction model in Pheromind V2 is through Olivia (AI System Coordinator / `bmad-orchestrator`).

1.  **Initiating Tasks:**

    - Address Olivia with your request. This could be a new feature, a bug report, a request for information, or a general goal.
    - Example: "Olivia, we need to implement the user authentication feature." or "Olivia, James reported a bug in the payment module, can you get it fixed?"
    - Olivia will analyze your request. If it's ambiguous, she will ask clarifying questions.

2.  **Olivia's Autonomous Dispatching, Monitoring, and Task Chaining:**

    - **Dispatch:** Olivia decomposes the request into tasks and dispatches them to the appropriate specialist agent (e.g., Analyst for research, SM for story writing, James for development, Quinn for QA).
    - **Monitoring:** After a task is completed by an agent, they will report their status (implicitly or explicitly). Olivia expects Saul to process these reports and update the `.bmad-state.json` file.
    - **Task Chaining:** Olivia monitors the `.bmad-state.json` file. When Saul updates it (e.g., `dev_complete` signal from James's work), Olivia analyzes the new state and autonomously determines the next logical step according to workflow definitions (like `hybrid-pheromind-workflow.yml`) and current needs.
      - Example chain: User requests feature -> Olivia tasks Analyst -> Analyst provides brief -> Olivia tasks SM -> SM writes story -> Olivia tasks James (Dev) -> James codes -> Saul updates state to `dev_complete` -> Olivia tasks Quinn (QA) -> Quinn tests.

3.  **Automated Escalation Path for Development Tasks:**

    - Olivia monitors development tasks for repeated failures (based on state updates from Saul).
    - If James (Dev) fails to complete a task (e.g., tests don't pass) after a configured number of attempts (e.g., 2-3 attempts), Olivia initiates an escalation:
      1.  Tasks Dexter (Debugger) to analyze the failing code and tests. Dexter produces a diagnostic report.
      2.  Saul processes Dexter's report, updating the state.
      3.  Olivia re-tasks James (Dev) with the original task, now providing Dexter's diagnostic report as additional input.
      4.  If James still fails, Olivia might (based on state or further configuration) task Rocco (Refactorer) if significant `tech_debt` is signaled, or flag the persistent issue for user review.

4.  **Research Request Workflow:**
    - If an agent (like Analyst or James) identifies an information gap:
      - The agent formulates a specific question or search query.
      - The agent's report to Saul will indicate this (`research_query_pending` signal).
    - Saul processes the report and adds a `research_query_pending` signal to `.bmad-state.json`.
    - Olivia detects this signal and presents the research request (query and requesting agent) to the user.
    - The user performs the research and provides the findings back to Olivia.
    - Olivia relays the findings to the original requesting agent (or makes it available for their next active session).
    - The agent uses the findings and reports back to Saul, who then might add a `research_findings_received` signal.

## 6. Using Team Definitions for High-Level Planning

(This section would describe how pre-defined teams like `team-fullstack.yml` can be used, perhaps by loading all their agents into an environment for a broader discussion or initial planning phase before narrowing down to Olivia's coordinated workflow. For manual setup, this is less about automated loading and more about understanding which group of agents might be relevant for what type of project or phase.)

While Olivia serves as the day-to-day coordinator, you can conceptually use team definitions (like those in `bmad-core/agent-teams/`) to understand which sets of agents are designed for particular project types (e.g., `team-fullstack.yml` for web apps, `team-maintenance.yml` for bug-fixing and refactoring).

In a manual setup, this means being aware of these roles and ensuring the relevant agent `.md` files are accessible if you were to manually switch between them for a broader strategic discussion outside of Olivia's direct task management. However, the V2 workflow encourages funneling most requests through Olivia.

## 7. Key Agent Interactions

- **Olivia (Orchestrator):** Your main point of contact. She takes your requests, dispatches tasks, monitors state via Saul, chains subsequent tasks, and manages escalations.
- **Saul (Scribe/`bmad-master`):** Works in the background. Processes reports from all other agents and updates the `.bmad-state.json` file. You typically don't interact with Saul directly once the workflow is running via Olivia.
- **James (Developer/`dev`):** Receives coding tasks from Olivia. Reports progress/completion (including any research needs/findings) for Saul to process.
- **Quinn (QA/`qa`):** Receives testing tasks from Olivia, usually after James completes development. Reports test results for Saul to process.
- **Dexter (Debugger/`debugger`):** Dispatched by Olivia when James's tasks fail repeatedly. Provides diagnostic reports.
- **Rocco (Refactorer/`refactorer`):** Dispatched by Olivia for code quality improvements or if tech debt is blocking development.
- **Mary (Analyst/`analyst`):** Handles initial research, brainstorming, and document creation (like project briefs or PRDs). Can be tasked by Olivia or interacted with directly for planning phases. Will request user-assisted research for information gaps.
- **Other Standard Agents (PM, PO, SM, UX-Expert):** These agents (John, Sarah, Bob, Sally) perform their specialized roles, typically tasked by Olivia as needed within a larger workflow (e.g., SM for story writing before Dev, UX for UI specs).

This manual provides a foundational understanding for setting up and using the Pheromind V2 system. The core idea is to leverage Olivia as the central intelligence, coordinating the specialist agents based on the evolving project state managed by Saul.
