# Stigmergy System State Schema

This document defines the official schema for the `.ai/state.json` file. This file is the **sacred ledger** of the swarm's activity and the sole source of truth for project state. All agents MUST read from and write to this file in accordance with this schema.

## Root Object

-   **`schema_version`** (String): The version of this schema. e.g., "2.0".
-   **`project_name`** (String): The user-defined name of the project.
-   **`autonomy_mode`** (Enum: "supervised" | "autonomous"): Determines if the swarm proceeds automatically after planning.
-   **`project_status`** (Enum): The current high-level status of the project.
    -   `NEEDS_BRIEFING`: Awaiting creation of `docs/brief.md`.
    -   `NEEDS_PLANNING`: Awaiting creation of PRD, architecture, and project manifest.
    -   `READY_FOR_EXECUTION`: Blueprint is complete, swarm can begin building.
    -   `EXECUTION_IN_PROGRESS`: Actively working on stories.
    -   `EXECUTION_HALTED`: An un-recoverable error occurred.
    -   `PROJECT_COMPLETE`: All manifest epics are complete.
-   **`system_signal`** (String): The last signal left by an agent, used for inter-agent communication. e.g., "INIT", "STORY_CREATED", "ESCALATION_REQUIRED".
-   **`project_manifest`** (Object): The master plan derived from the PRD.
    -   **`epics`** (Array of Objects): A list of all project epics.
        -   `epic_id` (Number): e.g., 1.
        -   `title` (String): The title of the epic.
        -   `status` (Enum: "PENDING" | "IN_PROGRESS" | "COMPLETE").
        -   `stories` (Array of Objects): A list of stories within the epic.
            -   `story_id` (String): e.g., "1.1".
            -   `title` (String): The title of the story.
            -   `status` (Enum: "PENDING" | "IN_PROGRESS" | "AWAITING_VERIFICATION" | "COMPLETE" | "FAILED").
-   **`history`** (Array of Objects): The **immutable ledger** of all system actions. This is append-only.
    -   `timestamp` (String): ISO 8601 timestamp.
    -   `agent_id` (String): The ID of the acting agent (e.g., "saul", "james").
    -   `signal` (String): The signal generated by the agent's action.
    -   `summary` (String): A human-readable summary of the action taken.
    -   `files_modified` (Array of Strings): A list of file paths created or changed during the action.
-   **`issue_log`** (Array of Objects): A log of persistent failures requiring a Responder.
    -   `issue_id` (String): A unique ID for the issue.
    -   `timestamp` (String): ISO 8601 timestamp when the issue was logged.
    -   `status` (Enum: "OPEN" | "IN_PROGRESS" | "RESOLVED" | "FAILED_TO_RESOLVE").
    -   `summary` (String): A description of the failure.
    -   `history_ref` (Array of Strings): Timestamps referencing the related events in the `history` ledger.
