# Stigmergy: The Autonomous AI Development Swarm

Stigmergy is not a tool; it's an autonomous partner. It translates your strategic vision into a production-ready application by orchestrating a swarm of specialized AI agents.

The system operates on a state-driven "glass box" model. You set the goal and the constraints, and the swarm takes over, managing the entire lifecycle from market research and architecture to coding, verification, and self-improvement.

## The Stigmergy Experience

1.  **Convene:** In your IDE, activate the Chief Strategist, **`@saul`**.
2.  **Directive:** Provide your high-level project goal (e.g., `*begin_project brief.md`).
3.  **Approve:** The Planners will create a blueprint. Once you give the final strategic approval, you can put the system into hands-free mode.
4.  **Engage Autonomy:**
    > `*set_autonomy autonomous`

The swarm will now execute the entire project manifest without further intervention.

## The Autonomous Cycle

Saul, the system's **Interpreter**, will now initiate the Stigmergy Cycle.

-   **Planners** like `@mary` (Analyst) and `@winston` (Architect) will use research tools to create a lean, viable blueprint.
-   Once the `autonomy_mode` is set, the swarm will execute the plan stored in `.ai/state.json`.
-   **Executors** like `@james` (Developer) will write code based on specific work orders, forbidden from asking for user feedback.
-   **Verifiers** like `@quinn` (QA) will programmatically run tests.
-   **Responders** like `@dexter` (Debugger) will automatically analyze failures recorded in the state ledger.

You are the founder, not the mechanic.

## Installation

```bash
# Run this command in the root of your project folder
