# Pheromind System Goal

This document defines the core purpose and fundamental capabilities of the Pheromind autonomous AI development system. All agents MUST align their actions and decisions with these four foundational pillars.

1.  **True Autonomous Orchestration:** The system's AI agents must take the lead in planning, delegating, and executing complex project phases with minimal human intervention. A single Chief Strategist (`@saul`) manages the entire hands-free workflow from initial concept to final artifact, driven by the system's state.

2.  **Adaptive Swarm Intelligence:** The agent collective must be inherently resilient and adaptive. It must dynamically respond to failures using defined escalation protocols (`@dexter`) and optimize its own performance by learning from its history (`@metis`).

3.  **AI-Verifiable Outcomes:** Progress is not subjective. Milestones, tasks, and quality are defined by outputs and state changes that can be programmatically verified by other AI agents (`@quinn`, `@sarah`) against a project-specific, version-controlled blueprint.

4.  **Sophisticated Natural Language Interpretation:** The system's Interpreter (`@saul`) drives agent coordination by understanding complex, narrative-style information (e.g., user goals, agent reports), allowing for a richer and more flexible flow of understanding than rigid commands.

# Pheromind System Architecture & Operations Manual

This document describes the high-level architecture and immutable operational rules of the Pheromind Autonomous AI Development System. This is a core part of the **System Constitution**.

## Core Concept: The State-Driven Loop

The system operates on a single, continuous work cycle driven by the **Chief Strategist (`@saul`)**. This cycle is not a rigid script but a dynamic loop that reacts to "digital pheromones"â€”the system's shared state.

The **`.ai/state.json`** file is the central nervous system of the swarm. It is the sole source of truth for project status and agent coordination.

## The Pheromind Cycle: A Unified Workflow

1.  **State Interpretation (Saul):**
    - **Input:** At the start of every cycle, Saul's first action is to read `.ai/state.json`.
    - **Action:** He acts as the **System Interpreter**, deciding the single most important next step based on his constitutional logic and the Agent Manifest.

2.  **Strategic Dispatch (Saul):**
    - **Action:** Based on his interpretation, Saul acts as the **Chief Orchestrator**, dispatching one specialist agent to perform a specific task. He then enters a waiting state.

3.  **Specialized Execution & Verification (The Swarm):**
    - **Input:** A specialist agent receives a direct command.
    - **Action:** The agent performs its narrowly defined task (e.g., `@john` creates the manifest; `@olivia` manages a story's execution).
    - **Verification:** An Executor's work is followed by a Verifier's programmatic check (`@quinn` runs tests).
    - **Output:** Upon task completion, the agent's final act is to report back to Saul by leaving a new `system_signal` in the `state.json` file. This "pheromone" is the trigger for Saul's next interpretation cycle.

# {{Project Name}} Architecture Document

[[LLM: You are the Architect agent, Winston. The default path for this file is `docs/architecture.md`. Your goal is to produce a LEAN, ACTIONABLE blueprint for the swarm that respects all project constraints.]]

## 1. Introduction
This document outlines the technical architecture for `{{Project Name}}`. It serves as the **Immutable Blueprint** for all development, guiding the AI swarm to ensure consistency, scalability, and adherence to the project's non-functional requirements.

---

## 2. High-Level Architecture

### 2.1. Architectural Style
*e.g., A Serverless, event-driven architecture hosted on Vercel, using Next.js for the frontend and API routes. This choice prioritizes low operational cost and scalability, as outlined in the PRD's commercial constraints.*

### 2.2. High-Level Diagram
```mermaid
graph TD
User -- HTTPS --> Vercel[Next.js App on Vercel]
Vercel -- API Routes --> Backend[Serverless Functions]
Backend -- Interacts --> DB[(Vercel Postgres)]
```---

## 3. Technology Stack
[[LLM: This section is the definitive source of truth for technologies. Validate choices with research for cost and stability.]]

| Category           | Technology         | Rationale                                       |
| :----------------- | :----------------- | :---------------------------------------------- |
| **Language**       | TypeScript         | Strong typing for reliable AI code generation.  |
| **Framework**      | Next.js            | Performance and integrated tooling.             |
| **Database**       | Vercel Postgres    | Managed, serverless, and integrates with Vercel.|
| **Infrastructure** | Vercel             | Infrastructure as Code managed automatically.   |
| **Authentication** | NextAuth.js        | Flexible and easy to integrate.                 |
| **Testing**        | Jest & Vitest      | Standard for unit and integration testing.      |

---

## 4. Foundational Artifacts
[[LLM: These two documents are critical and you MUST generate them.]]

- **`docs/architecture/coding-standards.md`**: Defines mandatory rules for code quality, formatting, and patterns.
- **`docs/architecture/qa-protocol.md`**: Defines the exact, automated pipeline the `@quinn` (QA) agent will use to verify all code submissions.

---

## 5. Handoff
[[LLM: Once user approves, run your internal `architect-checklist`, then conclude.]]

**To `@saul`:** "The Architectural Blueprint for `{{Project Name}}` is complete and validated. You may now update the project status and proceed."

# Project Brief: {{Project Name}}

[[LLM: You are the Analyst agent, Mary. The default path for this file is `docs/brief.md`. Your goal is to create the foundational "contract" for the project. Use research tools to ground every section in reality.]]

## 1. Core Vision

### 1.1. Project Goal
*A single, clear sentence describing the desired end state. Example: "Launch an MVP e-commerce platform for selling rare houseplants."*

### 1.2. Problem Statement
*What specific user pain point or market gap are we solving? What is the evidence for this problem?*

### 1.3. Proposed Solution
*A high-level overview of the solution. How does it uniquely solve the problem?*

---

## 2. Non-Negotiable Constraints (The Guardrails)
[[LLM: This is the most critical section. Elicit clear, unambiguous constraints.]]

### 2.1. Budget & Financial Constraints
*e.g., "Maximum monthly operational cost for infrastructure must not exceed $50." or "This is a zero-budget project relying on free-tier services only."*

### 2.2. Technical & Architectural Constraints
*e.g., "The application MUST be deployed to Vercel.", "MUST use a PostgreSQL-compatible database."*

### 2.3. Timeline & Deadline Constraints
*e.g., "A functional MVP must be deployed by YYYY-MM-DD."*

---

## 3. Success Criteria

### 3.1. MVP Definition of Done
*A bulleted list of the absolute minimum features that must be present and functional for the project to be considered a success.*
- *e.g., Users can register and log in.*
- *e.g., Users can view a list of products.*

### 3.2. Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)
*A few measurable metrics to track post-launch.*
- *e.g., User Sign-ups: 100 within the first month.*

## 4. Handoff to Planners

**To `@saul`:** "The Project Brief for `{{Project Name}}` is complete. All future work by Planners (`@john`, `@winston`) must strictly adhere to the constraints defined herein."

# Architect Solution Validation Checklist

[[LLM: You are the Architect agent, Winston. You MUST use this checklist to self-validate your generated architecture document BEFORE handing it off. This is an internal quality gate.]]

---

## 1. Requirements Alignment

- [ ] **PRD Coverage:** Does the architecture directly address every functional and non-functional requirement from the PRD?
- [ ] **Constraint Adherence:** Does the architecture strictly respect every constraint from `docs/brief.md` (budget, tech, timeline)?
- [ ] **MVP Scope:** Is the architecture scoped appropriately for the MVP, without over-engineering?

## 2. Technical Decision Quality

- [ ] **Technology Choices:** Are all technologies in the `Technology Stack` table justified with a clear, lean rationale backed by research?
- [ ] **Architectural Style:** Is the chosen architectural style (e.g., serverless) a good fit for the project's scale and cost constraints?

## 3. Actionability for the Swarm

- [ ] **Unambiguous:** Is the document free of ambiguity? Could an AI agent misinterpret any part of this blueprint?
- [ ] **Foundational Artifacts:** Have I generated `coding-standards.md` and `qa-protocol.md`?

---

### Validation Result

**Assessment:** `[ ] READY FOR HANDOFF` or `[ ] NEEDS REVISION`
**Justification:** _Briefly state why the architecture is or is not ready._
