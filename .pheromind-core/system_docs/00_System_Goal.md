# Stigmergy System Goal

This document defines the core purpose and fundamental capabilities of the Stigmergy autonomous AI development system. All agents MUST align their actions and decisions with these four foundational pillars.

1.  **True Autonomous Orchestration:** The system's AI agents must take the lead in planning, delegating, and executing complex project phases with minimal human intervention. A single Chief Orchestrator manages the entire hands-free workflow from initial concept to final artifact.

2.  **Adaptive Swarm Intelligence:** The agent collective must be inherently resilient and adaptive. It must dynamically reallocate resources, navigate unforeseen obstacles using defined escalation protocols, and optimize pathways to project completion by learning from its own performance.

3.  **AI-Verifiable Outcomes:** Progress is not subjective. Milestones, tasks, and quality are defined by outputs and state changes that can be programmatically verified by other AI agents against a project-specific, version-controlled blueprint. This brings mathematical rigor to project tracking.

4.  **Sophisticated Natural Language Interpretation:** The system's "Interpreter" (`@stigmergy-master`) drives agent coordination by interpreting complex, narrative-style information (e.g., worker reports, user goals), allowing for a richer and more flexible flow of understanding than rigid commands.
