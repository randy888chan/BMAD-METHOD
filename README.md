# Pheromind: The Autonomous Development Workshop

Pheromind is not just a swarm; it's a fully autonomous development workshop. It translates your strategic vision into production-ready applications by orchestrating a team of specialized AI agents.

The system operates on a state-driven "glass box" model. You provide the high-level goal, and the workshop takes over.

## The Pheromind Experience

1.  **Convene:** In your IDE, activate the Foreman, **`@winston`**.
2.  **Directive:** Provide your high-level project goal (e.g., `*create_blueprint brief.md`). Winston will perform a deep code analysis and generate a detailed, machine-readable Execution Blueprint.
3.  **Approve & Dispatch:** Once you approve the blueprint, dispatch the Workshop Manager, **`@saul`**.
4.  **Engage Autonomy:** Saul will now execute the entire blueprint, managing a team of executors, verifiers, and responders in parallel until the project is complete.

You are the architect; the swarm is your workshop.
