# validate-consolidated-fixes

**Agent:** architect  
**Type:** BatchTask

## Purpose

Validate that consolidated fixes have been properly implemented by examining story documentation and using Playwright MCP for UX changes, serving as the single validation gate for Round 2+ iterations.

## Context

This task provides efficient architect-only validation after comprehensive Round 1 reviews:
- Validates fixes against original consolidated feedback
- Uses story documentation as primary evidence source
- Employs Playwright MCP for UX validation when needed
- Provides final approval or requests additional fixes
- Eliminates need for full re-review cycles

## Inputs

### Required
- `story_file` (string): Path to story file with implementation details
- `original_feedback` (object): Original consolidated feedback for comparison
- `implemented_fixes` (object): Summary of changes implemented by dev

## Outputs

- `validation_status` (string): "APPROVED" | "NEEDS_FIXES" | "BLOCKED"
- `validation_results` (object): Detailed validation findings
- `additional_feedback` (string): Specific guidance for any remaining issues
- `story_file` (string): Updated story file with validation results

## Instructions

### Pre-Validation Analysis

1. **Review implementation documentation**
   - Read story file implementation section thoroughly
   - Compare implemented fixes against original consolidated feedback
   - Identify any REQUIRED-FOR-COMPLETION items that were not addressed
   - Note any technical decisions or changes made during implementation

2. **Assess validation approach needed**
   - Identify which fixes require technical code review
   - Determine which changes need UX validation via Playwright
   - Note any business logic changes requiring functional testing
   - Plan validation sequence based on dependencies

### Validation Process

3. **Validate technical fixes**
   
   **Architecture fixes validation:**
   - Review code changes described in story documentation
   - Verify security improvements implemented correctly
   - Check performance optimizations are reasonable
   - Confirm technical debt addressed appropriately
   
   **Quality fixes validation:**
   - Verify test coverage improvements documented
   - Check that quality gates are passing
   - Confirm code quality standards maintained
   - Validate error handling additions

4. **Validate business fixes**
   
   **Acceptance criteria validation:**
   - Confirm AC adjustments align with business requirements
   - Verify business rule corrections documented properly
   - Check user journey improvements are logical
   - Validate data validation enhancements
   
   **Epic alignment validation:**
   - Ensure changes maintain epic scope and objectives
   - Verify business value delivery still intact
   - Check that project phase boundaries respected

5. **Validate UX fixes using project-appropriate testing tools**
   
   **When UX validation needed:**
   - User interface changes described in story (web, desktop, mobile, CLI, etc.)
   - User interaction flow modifications
   - Accessibility improvements requiring testing
   - Design consistency updates
   
   **Comprehensive UI Testing Protocol:**
   
   **Phase 1: Environment Setup**
   - Launch UI testing tools as specified in project documentation (check README.md or test configuration)
   - Use clean testing environment appropriate for project type (browser, desktop app, mobile simulator, CLI, etc.)
   - Clear relevant caches and state according to project architecture
   - Set appropriate viewport/window size for project target platform
   - Configure testing environment for debugging (enable logging as per project standards)
   
   **Phase 2: Pre-Testing Validation**
   - Navigate to application entry point (URL, app launch, CLI command, etc.)
   - Verify application loads/starts without errors (check relevant logs)
   - Take baseline screenshot/capture of unaffected areas for comparison
   - Document initial application state and version
   
   **Phase 3: Feature-Specific Testing**
   - Navigate systematically to each UI area mentioned in story fixes
   - For each changed component/page:
     * Capture screenshot BEFORE interacting
     * Test all documented user interactions (clicks, form submissions, navigation)
     * Verify visual changes match story implementation descriptions
     * Test error states and edge cases if applicable
     * Capture screenshot AFTER each significant interaction
     * Validate loading states and transitions work correctly
   
   **Phase 4: Accessibility & Responsive Testing (if applicable to project type)**
   - Test keyboard/alternative navigation for new/changed interactive elements
   - Verify accessibility features if improvements documented (ARIA, screen reader compatibility, etc.)
   - Test responsive behavior according to project target platforms (mobile, tablet, desktop, multiple screen sizes)
   - Validate contrast and readability for visual changes according to project standards
   
   **Phase 5: Cross-Platform Compatibility (if critical changes)**
   - Repeat core tests across project target platforms (different browsers, OS versions, device types, etc.)
   - Document any platform-specific issues discovered
   - Capture comparative evidence across platforms for visual/behavioral changes
   
   **Phase 6: Evidence Documentation and Cleanup**
   - Save all screenshots/captures to temporary validation directory with descriptive filenames (feature_state_timestamp.png)
   - Record any errors or warnings encountered in relevant logs
   - Document specific testing commands/tools used for reproducibility
   - Create testing summary with pass/fail status for each tested component
   - Note: All testing artifacts are temporary and will be cleaned up after validation completion
   
   **Testing Session Management:**
   - Maintain consistent testing context throughout validation for consistency
   - Reset application state between major test sections to ensure clean state
   - Restart testing environment if session becomes unstable
   - Document testing tool versions and configuration used (refer to project documentation)
   - Clean up testing sessions and temporary files after validation
   
   **File Management:**
   - All screenshots and evidence saved to temporary validation workspace
   - Artifacts automatically cleaned up after validation completion
   - Only validation results and decisions persisted in story documentation
   - No permanent files created during browser testing process

## Failure Conditions

- Unable to validate fixes due to insufficient documentation
- Browser MCP testing fails for UX changes
- Critical regressions discovered during validation
- Original requirements misunderstood in implementation
- Technical blockers prevent completion

## Error Handling

If documentation is insufficient:
1. Request specific clarification from dev
2. Document what additional information is needed
3. Provide guidance on documentation standards
4. Validate what can be assessed from available information

If browser MCP testing fails:
1. **Document failure details comprehensively:**
   - Specific MCP tool and version used (Playwright MCP, Browser MCP, etc.)
   - Exact failure scenarios with timestamps
   - Browser console errors and MCP session logs
   - Screenshots of failure states if captured
   
2. **Attempt alternative browser MCP approaches:**
   - Try different browser MCP tool if available (switch from Playwright to Browser MCP)
   - Test in different browser engines (Chromium, Firefox, WebKit)
   - Use different viewport sizes to isolate responsive issues
   - Clear browser context completely and retry
   
3. **Fallback validation methods:**
   - Request manual testing documentation from dev with comprehensive screenshots
   - Require video screen recordings of user interactions for complex flows
   - Request specific console log outputs for JavaScript errors
   - Ask for accessibility audit results using browser dev tools
   
4. **Escalation procedures:**
   - Escalate to DevOps if browser MCP infrastructure issues suspected
   - Involve UX Expert for complex accessibility or interaction validation
   - Engage with development team for application-specific testing guidance
   - Consider scope adjustment if UX changes cannot be properly validated via available MCP tools

If validation reveals new issues:
1. Classify as REQUIRED-FOR-COMPLETION vs IMPROVEMENT
2. Provide clear guidance for resolution
3. Update feedback for next implementation cycle
4. Consider if scope adjustment needed
