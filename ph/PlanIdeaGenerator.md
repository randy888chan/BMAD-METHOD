# Zero-Code User Blueprint for SPARC Program Generation

**Project Title:** (Give your program idea a simple name)
**Prepared By:** (Your Name)
**Date:** (Today's Date)

**Instructions for You (The Visionary!):**

* **No Tech Jargon Needed!** Just describe your idea in plain English. Think about what you want the program to do and why, not how it does it technically.
* **Be Detailed:** The more information and specific examples you give, the better the AI (our team of virtual coding assistants, called SPARC) can understand and build exactly what you want. Imagine you're describing it to someone who needs to build it perfectly without asking you follow-up questions.
* **Focus on the Goal:** What problem does this solve? What process does it make easier?
* **Don't Worry About Code:** SPARC will figure out the best programming languages, databases, and technical stuff based on your description and its own research.

    * [ ] As a Mobile App (on Android phones/tablets)
    * [ ] As a Computer Program (installed on Windows)
    * [ ] As a Computer Program (installed on Mac)
    * [ ] Other (Please describe):
    * Your Primary Choice & any Secondary Choices:
2.  **(If Mobile App):** Does it need to work without an internet connection sometimes? (Yes/No/Not Sure - AI will research implications)
    * Your Answer:

---

## Section 7: The Rules & Boundaries - What are the non-negotiables?

1.  **Must-Have Rules:** Are there any critical rules the program must follow?
    * Examples: Users must be over 18, Prices must always show tax included, Specific information must be kept private, A specific calculation must be performed exactly this way.
    * Your Answer:
2.  **Things to Avoid:** Is there anything the program should absolutely not do?
    * Examples: Never share user emails, Don't allow users under 13 to sign up, Don't automatically charge a credit card.

---

## Section 8: Success Criteria - How do we know it's perfect?

1.  **Definition of Done:** Describe 2-3 simple scenarios. If the program handles these scenarios exactly as described, you'd consider it a success for that part.
    * Example 1: "When I sign up with my email and password, I should get a confirmation email, and then be able to log in immediately."
    * Example 2: "When I search for 'blue widgets', it should show me only blue widgets, displaying their picture, name, and price."

**Ready to Build!**

Once you submit this completed blueprint, the SPARC orchestration will take over. It will:

1.  Use **Deep Research** to analyze your vision, explore similar programs, investigate technical options, and fill in any knowledge gaps.
2.  Use the **Specification Writer** to turn your answers and the research into formal requirements.
3.  Use the **github mcp tool** to do deep research on templates across github looking for any templates that might work for the project.
4.  Use the **Architect** to design the system structure.
5.  Use the **high level test deep research tool** to deep research all the best high level tests to make for the project.
6.  Have the **tester** create ALL of the high level tests.
7.  Use **Code, TDD, Supabase Admin, MCP Integration, and Security Reviewer modes** iteratively to build, test, and secure the program based on the specifications and architecture.
8.  Use the **System Integrator** to connect all the pieces.
9.  Use the **Documentation Writer** to create guides.
10. Use **DevOps** to set up infrastructure and deploy the application.
