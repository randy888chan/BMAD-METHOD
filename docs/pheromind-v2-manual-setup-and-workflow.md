# Pheromind V2: Full IDE Setup & Workflow Guide

**Version:** 2.0
**Status:** This is the master setup document for the Pheromind autonomous swarm architecture.

## 1. Overview
This document provides the complete instructions for configuring your project to run the Pheromind V2 swarm entirely within a local IDE like Roo Code. It includes the definitive `.roomodes.json` configuration and the necessary modifications to integrate expansion packs.

## 2. The `.roomodes.json` Configuration
This is the central configuration for your IDE. It defines every agent in the swarm and embeds their core operational protocols.

**Action:** Replace the entire content of your project's root `roomodes.json` file with the content below.

## 4. Cost Optimization & LLM Tier Strategy

Here is a formal recommendation for assigning different AI model tiers to agent roles to balance cost and performance.

| Agent Role & Name                      | Recommended Tier                               | Justification for Tier Selection                                                                                                                                                                    |
|:---------------------------------------|:-----------------------------------------------|:--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Coordinator (Olivia)**               | **Tier 1 (e.g., Gemini 2.5 Pro)**                | **Mission-Critical.** This is the system's brain. Requires the highest reasoning capability to interpret complex state from signals, prioritize tasks, and manage the autonomous loop. |
| **Scribe (Saul)**                      | **Tier 1 (e.g., Gemini 2.5 Pro)**                | **Mission-Critical.** Tasked with the sophisticated interpretation of unstructured natural language into precise, structured JSON signals. Accuracy here is paramount to prevent state corruption. |
| **Architect (Winston)**                | Tier 1 / Tier 2                                | High-quality architecture prevents countless downstream problems. Use **Tier 1** for generating initial, complex documents. For reviews or small updates, **Tier 2** is sufficient. |
| **Analyst (Mary)**                     | Tier 1 / Tier 2                                | For creative brainstorming, a **Tier 2** model is fine. For code analysis or deep research prompt generation, **Tier 1** is required for depth and accuracy. |
| **Developer (James)**                  | **Tier 2 (e.g., Gemini 2.5 Flash)**            | **Workhorse Role.** Tasks are highly structured and scoped by detailed story files. Needs to be a fast, competent, and cost-effective coder, not a strategic thinker. |
| **Specialized Workers (QA, Debug, Refactor)** | Tier 1 / Tier 2                                | These agents perform high-impact, specialized tasks. A **Tier 1** model ensures the most accurate diagnosis (Debugger) or the highest quality output (QA, Refactorer). |
| **PM, PO, SM, UX Expert**                | **Tier 2 (e.g., Gemini 2.5 Flash)**            | These agents execute structured tasks using templates and checklists. They require reliability and thoroughness, which a balanced **Tier 2** model provides effectively. |
| **Smart Contract Agents** | **Tier 1 (e.g., Gemini 1.5 Pro)** | **High-Stakes Domain.** Due to the financial and security implications of smart contracts, all agents in this domain (Architect, Developer, Auditor) require the highest level of scrutiny, accuracy, and reasoning capability. No compromises here. |

This complete setup provides the robust, documented, and cost-aware framework you need to successfully run the Pheromind V2 system.
