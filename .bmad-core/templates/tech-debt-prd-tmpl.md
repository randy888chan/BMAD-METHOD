# Technical Debt Paydown PRD

## Overview
This PRD focuses on addressing accumulated technical debt that has reached a threshold requiring dedicated attention. The total estimated effort has exceeded 10 days, triggering the need for a focused debt reduction sprint.

## Current Debt Status
- **Total Items**: [Number]
- **Total Estimated Effort**: [Days]
- **High Priority Items**: [Number]
- **Medium Priority Items**: [Number]
- **Low Priority Items**: [Number]

## Debt Inventory

| Priority | Description | Effort | Risk | Impact | Story Origin |
|----------|-------------|--------|------|--------|--------------|
| HIGH | [Description] | [Days] | [Risk description] | [Systems affected] | [Story ref] |
| HIGH | [Description] | [Days] | [Risk description] | [Systems affected] | [Story ref] |
| MEDIUM | [Description] | [Days] | [Risk description] | [Systems affected] | [Story ref] |
| LOW | [Description] | [Days] | [Risk description] | [Systems affected] | [Story ref] |

## Prioritization Criteria

1. **High Risk**: Could cause production issues or security vulnerabilities
2. **High Friction**: Significantly slows development velocity
3. **Quick Wins**: Low effort, high impact improvements
4. **Foundation**: Blocks other improvements or feature development

## Proposed Approach

### Sprint 1: Critical Items (High Risk & High Friction)
- Address all HIGH priority items
- Focus on items that pose security or stability risks
- Target: [X] days of debt reduction

### Sprint 2: Foundation & Developer Experience
- Address MEDIUM priority items that improve developer velocity
- Fix foundational issues blocking other work
- Target: [X] days of debt reduction

### Ongoing: Quick Wins
- Incorporate LOW priority items into regular development
- Address when working in related code areas
- Target: Opportunistic improvement

## Success Metrics

- [ ] Reduction in bug reports related to debt areas
- [ ] Improved development velocity (measured by story completion rate)
- [ ] Reduced time spent on workarounds
- [ ] Improved code coverage in affected areas
- [ ] Reduced build/deployment times (if applicable)

## Non-Goals

- Feature development (unless required for debt paydown)
- Achieving perfection (aim for "good enough" improvements)
- Refactoring areas not identified in debt inventory
- Upgrading dependencies not related to identified debt

## Resource Requirements

- **Development Team**: [X developers for Y sprints]
- **Testing Resources**: [Additional testing needs]
- **Code Review**: [Senior developer review requirements]

## Risk Mitigation

| Risk | Mitigation Strategy |
|------|-------------------|
| Introducing new bugs during refactoring | Comprehensive test coverage before changes |
| Scope creep during debt paydown | Strict adherence to identified debt items |
| Business pressure for features | Clear communication of velocity improvements |

## Timeline

- **Start Date**: [Date]
- **Sprint 1 Completion**: [Date]
- **Sprint 2 Completion**: [Date]
- **Final Review**: [Date]

## Approval

- [ ] Product Owner
- [ ] Technical Lead
- [ ] Development Team
