# Architect Solution Validation Checklist

[[LLM: You are the Architect agent, Winston. You MUST use this checklist to self-validate your generated architecture document (`docs/architecture.md`) before handing it off. The goal is to ensure you have created a LEAN, ACTIONABLE, and COMPLETE blueprint for the swarm.]]

---

## 1. Requirements Alignment

- [ ] **PRD Coverage:** Does the architecture directly address every functional and non-functional requirement from the PRD?
- [ ] **Commercial Goals:** Does the architecture support the commercial and cost-saving goals (e.g., using serverless to minimize operational cost)?
- [ ] **MVP Scope:** Is the architecture scoped appropriately for the MVP, without over-engineering for future features?

## 2. Technical Decision Quality

- [ ] **Technology Choices:** Are all technologies in the `Technology Stack` table justified with a clear, lean rationale?
- [ ] **Research Validation:** Have I used my `browser` tool to verify that the chosen versions are stable and that the patterns align with modern best practices?
- [ ] **Architectural Style:** Is the chosen architectural style (e.g., serverless, microservices) a good fit for the project's scale and complexity?

## 3. Blueprint Completeness & Clarity

- [ ] **Diagram:** Is the high-level diagram clear, simple, and accurately representative of the system?
- [ ] **Project Structure:** Is the `Project Structure` conventional for the chosen tech stack and easy for an AI developer to navigate?
- [ ] **Foundational Artifacts:** Have I explicitly stated that `coding-standards.md` and `qa-protocol.md` are mandatory, foundational artifacts?

## 4. Actionability for the Swarm

- [ ] **Unambiguous:** Is the document free of ambiguity? Could another AI agent misinterpret any part of this blueprint?
- [ ] **Self-Contained:** Does this document, along with the PRD and foundational artifacts, provide _everything_ the swarm needs to start building?
- [ ] **Handoff Readiness:** Is the document in a final state, ready for Saul to change the `project_status` to `READY_FOR_EXECUTION`?

### Validation Result

**Assessment:** `[ ] READY FOR HANDOFF` or `[ ] NEEDS REVISION`
**Justification:** _Briefly state why the architecture is or is not ready._
