# Stigmergy: The Autonomous AI Development Swarm

Stigmergy is not a tool; it's an autonomous partner. It translates your strategic vision into a production-ready application by orchestrating a swarm of specialized AI agents.

The system operates on a state-driven "glass box" model. You set the goal and the constraints, and the swarm takes over, managing the entire lifecycle from market research and architecture to coding, verification, and self-improvement.

## The Stigmergy Experience

1.  **Convene:** In your IDE, activate the Chief Strategist, **`@saul`**.
2.  **Directive:** Provide your high-level project goal (e.g., `brief.md`).
3.  **Begin:**
    > `*begin_project brief.md`

That's it. Your primary involvement is now making key strategic approvals.

## The Autonomous Cycle

Saul, the system's **Interpreter**, will now initiate the Stigmergy Cycle.

-   **Planners** like `@mary` (Analyst) and `@winston` (Architect) will research the market, honor your constraints, and create a lean, viable blueprint for your approval.
-   Once you give the go-ahead, the swarm autonomously executes the plan based on the master **Project Manifest** stored in `.ai/state.json`.
-   **Executors** like `@james` (Developer) will write code based on specific, technically-rich work orders.
-   **Verifiers** like `@quinn` (QA) will programmatically run tests against a project-specific QA protocol. No human approval is needed for code verification.
-   **Responders** like `@dexter` (Debugger) will automatically analyze failures recorded in the state ledger.
-   **The System** logs every action, providing a complete audit trail and enabling true, data-driven self-improvement.

You are the founder, not the mechanic.
